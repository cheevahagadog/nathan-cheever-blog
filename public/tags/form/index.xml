      <description>The strangest homework assignment I received in college was to go outside after class and burrow into the ground. I did not complete that assignment. The next day my biology professor asked if any of us tried it. Nobody raised their hands. He then explained why. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s because you don&amp;rsquo;t have the right shape for burrowing! But a mole, with their small bodies, their paws and claws, they&amp;rsquo;re quite at home burrowing.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Achilles realizes he&amp;rsquo;s not immortal. He grows up. We have a sickness of immortality. You can be whatever you want. It&amp;rsquo;s like playing tennis with the net down. If there are no rules, frankly, then there&amp;rsquo;s no sense of the tragic. There&amp;rsquo;s no sense of the limitations of the human. And without a sense of limitations, funny enough, people become miserable.&amp;rdquo; https://youtu.be/mFWxELAjbyY?t=788
&amp;ldquo;The consequence of abolishing cultural taboos is not liberty but anomie.</description>
