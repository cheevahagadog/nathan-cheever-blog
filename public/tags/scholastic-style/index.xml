      <description>Article #13: Is there any value in the Past? Objection 1: It seems there is little value to the past because opportunity for action lies in the present. Since we cannot act in the past, and our purpose is to act rightly in this world, our focus should be on the present. The past holds lessons and data from which we may draw as required to meet our current needs, but the value of the past is defined only by its usefulness to the present and future.</description>
