      <description>One golden afternoon last October, while taking a walk, I wrote a thought down: &amp;ldquo;Eventually, my life will just be as good as my days. So I need to enjoy my days if I am going to enjoy my life.&amp;quot;
Embedded in there is the idea that no one state or achievement will likely &amp;ldquo;make&amp;rdquo; my life. Instead of some grandiose event, life&amp;rsquo;s quality is subject to more prosaic influences like the quality of our relationships, sleep, self-talk, hobbies, and food.</description>

      <description>There are special times in life to go all out.
Last year, I went all out on a 50-mile hike alone, completing it in 19 hours.
I learned some invaluable lessons like
 Don&amp;rsquo;t trust Google maps over mountains (I got lost) Always pack an extra almond poppyseed muffin. Stopping to rest only makes your legs hurt more.  More importantly, I learned that after being alone and exhausted for hours, all the noise in your head quiets down, and you come to know yourself and your limits.</description>

      <title>Political Correctness and Respect</title>

      <description>Just Respect Mobilized? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I know exactly what political correctness (to be referred to by &amp;lsquo;PC&amp;rsquo; from here on out) is. Is it speaking up for the historically marginalized, dispossessed of power? No, I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. That is activism, likely for political rights and status. And activism means expressing point publicly to cause a political or societal change. So I can see how the &amp;lsquo;political&amp;rsquo; aspect of PC can be associated with political activism, standing up for causes and such.</description>
