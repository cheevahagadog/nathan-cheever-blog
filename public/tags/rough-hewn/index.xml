      <description>One of my all time favorite quotes is by John Ruskin, who said,
 &amp;ldquo;The greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to see something and tell what it saw in a plain way. Hundreds of people can talk for one who can think, but thousands can think for one who can see.&amp;rdquo;
 Seers are few then, but when they tell what they see in a plain way, their talk is profoundly edifying.</description>
