      <description>What is this blog? Everything I write here is written with the intent to learn and explore ideas I find interesting. Maybe you will too! Why do it?:
 Alzheimers runs in my family and I want to keep my mind alive and growing so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t die before I do. I&amp;rsquo;m tired of putting it off. I want to be a better writer and thinker. I want to be an influence for good and pay it forward.</description>
