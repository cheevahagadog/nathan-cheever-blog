                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Philosophy and &hellip;newspapers!? What could these two totally unrelated things possibly have in common except being antiquated and therefore something I&rsquo;m bound to be interested in? Well, in this post I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ve discovered after weeks of intense research about the newspaper: the industry, the product, and the why behind it all (that&rsquo;s where the philosophy comes in!). If you stick around till the end, I&rsquo;ll layout what I think are the keys to using philosophy and some modern adaptations to revitalize the newspaper industry, and perhaps a sense of local community with it.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="the-story-of-newspapers">The story of newspapers</h2>
<p>Do you read the newspaper? To be honest, I haven&rsquo;t much either. I&rsquo;ve read a few that come in the mail for free. Sometimes there&rsquo;s a neat story about a teacher making a difference, a wrestling team that won state, or a piece about a city council meeting where they discussed how to pay for a decades-old water system. There are a few nice things, a cross-word puzzle here, perhaps a nice uplifting quote. But beyond that, it&rsquo;s mostly ads. And as a homeowner, sometimes I&rsquo;m interested in ads that offer a HVAC service discount, or a local window cleaner. Something like that might be nice.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t take a national paper like USA Today, The New York Times, or The Washington Post. That&rsquo;s not because I think they&rsquo;re inferior in anyway, but I frankly just don&rsquo;t want to pay for national information that I can find online for free. Call me a lousy citizen, but I&rsquo;m more interested in my local community calendar, my local school board, my local social happenings and history than I am in reading the analysis of issues that are happening far away. Of course there&rsquo;s a place for that kind of journalism absolutely! But when I want to understand my town or city, I find myself underserved. Why can&rsquo;t that NYT style of journalism and coverage be here in Stillwater, OK?</p>
<p>You could say, &ldquo;Well, the NYT and the like newspapers have some of the best journalists in the nation. And you&rsquo;re not going to find that kind of quality in every city or town.&rdquo; Good point. Great journalists might be hard to find in local commmunities. But the stories are not. And it&rsquo;s the <em>local stories</em> I want to know more about. I want to be more connected to my local community. I want to know why that road construction on Perkins Rd. is still not complete. I want to know what&rsquo;s happening, who&rsquo;s having birthdays, who&rsquo;s doing or saying what in city council.</p>
<p>Well, we do have a newspaper here. It has little of what I want. Like many local community papers, the quality of coverage as well as the quantity has eroded for a long time. Why? The simple answer is there&rsquo;s not enough money in it. Many local papers have either completely gone or have been bought up by a media conglomerate (like our local paper). There are some that are continuing the fight to provide accurate local stories and coverage and doing a fine job, but it&rsquo;s not an easy business. Many of these outliers have long histories of readers and editors who know the town like the back of their hand. They&rsquo;re supported by a community that&rsquo;s willing to pay.</p>
<p>The paper in my city is such a place. Though we don&rsquo;t live in a desert (and there are other very small town papers nearby) many locals I&rsquo;ve talked to don&rsquo;t take the paper. They dislike the fact that it&rsquo;s not locally owned, that the owning company in a different state pumps in it&rsquo;s own editorial content, and fills the paper with ads.</p>
<h2 id="beginning">Beginning</h2>
<p>Do you read your local newspaper? To be honest, I haven&rsquo;t much either. At least, not until recently. Perhaps that&rsquo;s why there is a not so silent assumption that the newspaper business is a losing venture. One only kept alive by die-hard devotees and civic saints who are as irreplaceable as they are valuable to the community. The ideal of thriving and successful local journalism/newspapers has not failed, but it&rsquo;s practicality has.</p>
<p>Why is that? If we stop and think about it, for a few hundred years, newspapers were pretty much <em>the</em> way to get any message out to a large number of people. Sure you could have a town-crier or hang up a billboard, but newspapers were the way of getting things done. Then along comes radio, then TV. By the time the internet comes along, things are starting to look not so good for papers who primarily depended on advertising income to pay for their overhead costs. Throw in social media and the 2020 pandemic, and papers are fighting for dear life.</p>
<p>To stay alive, many if not all moved their news online. This has many obvious benefits, it costs nothing to post new stories or share them. To monetize views, paywalls intercept you each time you click on an article. Banners and pop-up ads for women&rsquo;s spandex or denture implants barrage you as you try to read about the high-school football game. It is anything but a calm experience. And if those women&rsquo;s spandex do interest you and you click, you&rsquo;re whisked away from Johnny&rsquo;s football game to some crappy clickbait farm site. But hey, it&rsquo;s capitalism right?<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>To give news sites some credit, I feel confident for the most part that they don&rsquo;t love that experience either. But those are the ads they can get and they help keep the lights on. After all, they can&rsquo;t count on subscribers to pay.</p>
<h2 id="newspapers-tried-yet-untried">Newspapers: Tried Yet Untried</h2>
<p>But is this the reason why newspapers have failed? Have we decided we were tired of feeling the paper, sick of reading about local social happenings, through with having to jump around the pages to follow a story, and done with the static-ness of the fonts, the design? Are we tired of reading itself? Have we tried the concept of the newspaper and found it wanting? Or have we, especially the younger generations, ever really tried out the newspaper? Have we done our due diligence and passed a verdict to banish newspapers because they function too well as an instrument of calm, considered community connection and thought?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. I think many Americans, my previous self included, operated on an assumption that newspaper is just the antiquated ancestor to TikTok; that since local newspapers have been defeated they must have been disproved - an inferior stepping stone in the created destruction chain of capitalism.</p>
<p>G.K. Chesterton said, &ldquo;The [newspaper] ideal as not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult; and left untried.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> And that is true for today&rsquo;s readers. Trying out reading a newspaper regularly, especially for those 40 and under, would be a change and they would have to see and feel a tangible benefit to keep them reading (I&rsquo;ll discuss more about this later on).</p>
<p>Lest I risk sounding like more of a complete Luddite, I believe there are some of these technological advances which could help the physical paper not only survive as a medium of business but as a slave to the digital speedway of popups and distractions. We say &ldquo;I can just get it on my phone, &quot; but what we mean is look at. We look at our phones. We <em>read</em> the newspaper. The physical act of &ldquo;getting it&rdquo; on your phone is indistinguishable from any other thing you get on your phone. Some say this is a benefit. I say not. The phone no doubt has many helpful uses, but it also constricts and eliminates human action from our everyday portfolio of experience. The smart phone blends formerly distinct human actions into one. In a rush to recapture the pleasure once found in tangible and tactile human experiences, we look deeper down the digital rabbit-hole and remain unsatisfied. The worst problem of all though is not a lack of convenience but a vacuum of capacity. Things are so convenient that we&rsquo;re averse to do anything that requires thought. The loss of ability to sit still or care about reading print because its not on our phone could mean we lose everything that&rsquo;s not on our phones. And that&rsquo;s a lot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not anti-technology. I&rsquo;m not saying everyone should throw out their <del>devil-devices</del> smartphones. I am for us asking what do we want this smart phone technology for. I challenge the prevailing assumption that newer is better, that digital is more valuable as a principle. There are some human activities that require slowness, focus, thought, to yield their intended result.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> The question becomes not&quot;what&rsquo;s the latest, &quot; but &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the best tool for the job?&rdquo; The analog newspaper is a physical tie to not only your community but to reality. When it comes to understanding your world, especially your local community, I say the best technology is the older &mdash; the physical newspaper, coupled with conversation.</p>
<h2 id="news-deserts-on-the-rise">News deserts on the rise</h2>
<p>And it is such papers that are increasingly disappearing. Studies report that when a local paper fails corruption goes up, taxes creep up, and voters are less informed. People are less informed about their neighborhoods and town/city leadership. This is the distressing desertification of news spreading across the US. A third of newspapers are expected to disappear by 2025, after losing over one-fourth since 2005.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> And if the paper doesn&rsquo;t completely fail, often they are bought up by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/234685/leading-newspaper-companies-in-the-us-by-total-weekday-circulation/">larger media companies</a>. The largest one, Gannett, owns over 8000 local papers. And when a local paper is owned by a larger company, it is treated as a business asset, not a community asset. Your local paper is a means to the profits of a distant and absent rent collector rather than an instrument of public service.</p>
<h2 id="tilting-at-windmills">Tilting at Windmills</h2>
<p>So, to put my money where my mouth is, I have decided to try and make what I want to read: an independent, locally-owned and operated, hyper-local monthly (eventually I want to get to at least weekly, but shooting for monthly to start) physical newspaper for the city where I live.</p>
<p>I should in fairness add some minor caveats. I don&rsquo;t have a press. I don&rsquo;t even have a degree in communications or journalism. Newspapers, even local ones, used to take dozens of professionals and I&rsquo;m not even a professional! Why should I think that anyone would want to buy such a paper let alone that I can make it? Not to mention, how on earth will I finance it? Finally, there&rsquo;s already a paper here (owned by a distant rent-collector and hated by the locals) that I&rsquo;d be competing with head on!</p>
<p>Like I said, just a few caveats.</p>
<p>Actually, that was just a sampling of the surge of discouraging thoughts one faces when you look at doing this. This is not an idea you see on YouTube in the &ldquo;Best businesses to start in 2024&rdquo; deluge. Unless you have an abundance of resources, financial and otherwise, and a lot of spunk, the idea fails in the practicality score.</p>
<p>As I started searching for how to even do a newspaper business, I learned that the main way to do it was to sell ads. Some papers sell LOTS of ads. And if you fill a 16 page paper with colored ads, find a cheap printing service and blast it out to 10,000 homes in your area, then yeah you can make good money believe it or not. If you&rsquo;re feeling generous, sprinkle in a few local takes, highlight some sports, or even some syndicated columns or puzzles. You&rsquo;d charge nothing to the customer and make money selling ads. Some variation on this is what&rsquo;s recommended online. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t compete with an established paper,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;find an underserved niche market and target them with your free weekly.&rdquo; That is one way one person with no experience <em>could</em> make money doing a local paper of sorts.</p>
<p>But I was turned off by the idea. It prioritizes ads and spamming locals. Sure it&rsquo;s not illegal and we&rsquo;re used to it, but that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m reaching for. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, ads have a place in the newspaper. Especially when those ads are local businesses you&rsquo;re paper would be supporting. But do you ever seriously read those papers that show up in your mailbox overrun with ads and coupons? For me, at least, it merits a 2-second glance then it goes to the recycle bin. I didn&rsquo;t want it; I didn&rsquo;t pay for it, so why should I look at it? It&rsquo;s function is something to look at, not to be read. So that idea is out.</p>
<p>A variation that is doing well in some places is the free weekly local paper. Free weeklies like the <a href="https://huckleberrypress.com/a-conversation-with-huckleberry-press-editor-val-mohney/">Huckleberry Press</a> and <a href="https://nwlocalpaper.com/">The Local</a> seem to be doing well to gain grassroots support. They&rsquo;re free to pickup and read. They make enough money to employ a small group of people to assemble and print the paper by selling ads. Sometimes, the free weeklies need to fill up 50-70% of their paper with ads. With a decent distribution in a community, companies would see that as a great way to get their ads infront of people. Non-profit or not-for-profit hybrids are being explored as well, mainly powered by volunteer community writers and/or veteran journalists and editors stepping up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hit and miss across the country. Perhaps mostly miss. For paid newspapers in small towns, finding companies who can afford to take out ads and access to a nearby print contractor can make staying in business extremely challenging, if not impossible. Moving to a free-weekly model would possibly push out valuable written content to make way for ads.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe that people should support the local paper. If it&rsquo;s free, then you shouldn&rsquo;t expect much more than ads. The cost should be fair, accessible to almost anyone and the value should be high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, got it Nate,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re probably thinking. &ldquo;So how are you going to do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;Wait for it…</p>
<p>ChatGPT!</p>
<p>Just kidding. Nope, no ChatGPT to the rescue here. This one is already getting rather long so I&rsquo;ll save it for the next one.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-local-newspapers-local-newspapers">The Future of Local Newspapers; Local Newspapers</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon to hear in political speeches phrases like, &ldquo;We cannot go back to what was. Instead, we must forge ahead, striking out new paths and &hellip;blah, blah, blah&rdquo;. Sometimes that is the case, but it is not categorically true. Here again, Mr. Chesterton throws down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;There is one metaphor of which the moderns are very fond; there are always saying, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t put the clock back.&rsquo; The simple and obvious answer is &lsquo;You can.&rsquo; A clock, being a piece of human construction, can be restored by the human finger to any figure or hour. In the same way society, being a piece of human construction, can be reconstructed upon any plan that has ever existed.&rdquo;</em><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chesterton is challenging that &ldquo;deep and silent modern assumption that past things have become impossible.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> I agree with Chesterton. Not that I think we should go back to the technical processes of making the paper, using a retrofitted winepress or metal typesetting, but we, with our technological advances can at least maintain or improve upon the newspaper as an artifact of local culture and a way to unite readers attention to their neighbors and issues. If the paper used to serve the public, and the paper is dying, then we ought to put the clock back! We don&rsquo;t need to go back to old ways of producing the physical paper. But why give up on producing the kind of paper they used to?</p>
<p>Let me show you some examples of the qualities I&rsquo;m talking about. One paper I&rsquo;ve studied and found heart-warming is <em>The Daily Record</em> from Dunn, N.C. Established by Hoover Adams 1950 as a daily competitor to <em>The Dunn Dispatch</em>. Why some obscure daily paper from North Carolina? On the day they printed their first edition, Wednesday December 6, 1950, they had more than 160 citizens phone or write in wanting to be the first subscribers. It was a record breaking day, publishing 12,000 papers in the area. The population of Dunn that year was a little more 6,300 people.</p>
<p>And if the printing press revolutionized society before, why not again?</p>
