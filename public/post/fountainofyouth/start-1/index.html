                <p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>Jesse parked and shut off the engine and stepped outside. The nursing home seemed even more depressing on a cold grey March Tuesday at 4 pm. Something about the time of day soured his spirits. Heading towards the entrance, through the double sliding doors, he saw that the home was mostly empty. No one was there to greet him. In the reception area were screens playing loops of advertisements. On the corkboard panels next to the information desk he noticed fliers for wheelchairs for sale, walkers, even hearing aids. All of it was second-hand, no longer needed.</p>
<p>Jesse&rsquo;s grandpa was among the few remaining residents in the nursing home. In fact, calling it a nursing home wasn&rsquo;t technically correct anymore. The company was converting the building into a _ and were no longer accepting new patients or &ldquo;residents&rdquo;. While he stayed there, they said they were dedicated to providing quality care, but their attentions were focused on the new developments.</p>
<p>Along the hallway were small light sconces that came to Jesse&rsquo;s shoulders. Jesse was a tall, slim, yet built twenty-one year old. Almost halfway through his Bachelor&rsquo;s degree studying Finance, he. He hated school. He wanted to study literature but his parents wouldn&rsquo;t have it.</p>
<p>Arriving at room 35, he knocked. Through the door he could hear music being played. It sounded like Jazz. Grandpa loved jazz. His favorites were the classics: Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington, Louis and Ella. When it wasn&rsquo;t Jazz it was Beethoven&rsquo;s piano sonatas or possibly the local radio. He also had a collection of speeches and lectures on philosophy and history. Jesse&rsquo;s brothers found their grandpa boring and outdated, but Jesse always felt like he found an adult who would look him in the eye and care about his life.
He liked to listen to talks while he did the dishes, or some other kind of mindless work. His father before him, Jesse&rsquo;s great-grandfather, passed away of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and he wanted to try to keep his mind sharp as he could.</p>
<p>Jesse waited. No answer. He rang instead of knocking this time. He heard his grandpa say &ldquo;Be with you in a minute!&rdquo;, and the sound of the music dying away. As he waited for his grandpa to answer, a smile crept over his face. He couldn&rsquo;t wait to see his grandpa. He&rsquo;d always had a close connection to him, even more than his own dad, who always seemed preoccupied with himself more than his kids. His mom wasn&rsquo;t much better either in that department. All she seemed capable of talking about was calendar events and transactional necessities. Though she told herself and her kids that family was the most important thing, she was inept at talking about anything below household management. She had feelings for her kids, but was unable or unwilling to express them. Things weren&rsquo;t much better in the marriage. No wonder they got divorced.</p>
<p>The door opened with a quick pull, more powerful than Jessie expected. It wasn&rsquo;t even locked apparently. Stephen, Jesse&rsquo;s grandpa looked up and said &ldquo;Hey! It&rsquo;s Jess! Come on in!&rdquo; . He was wearing grey fluffy slippers, a dinner jacket and a buttondown shirt. His slacks were held up by an old pair of suspenders. This iwas more dressed up than Jesse usually saw him on his weekly visits.The local news softly droned on in the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you doing grandpa?&rdquo; Jesse said with a big hug. Then he noticed the smell of the room was different. It was fresh like a woman&rsquo;s perfume.
&ldquo;Wow it smells nice in here Grandpa&rdquo;, said Jesse.
&ldquo;Oh that,&rdquo; said Stephen, putting his right hand in the air and waving it down, as if trying to swipe a fruit fly. &ldquo;Rose was here earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, you still seeing her? How&rsquo;s that going?&rdquo;, asked Jesse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes in-deed. We&rsquo;ve been getting along great. She&rsquo;s a fine woman. So much like your grandmother. Except&hellip;&rdquo;, Stephen trailed off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except?&rdquo;, Jesse asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be moving out of here at the end of the month. She no longer needs this place. She&rsquo;s taking a new job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s cool. What&rsquo;s she going to be doing?&rdquo;, Jesse asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s uh&hellip;let me see if I can rememberâ€¦something about counseling.&rdquo; Stephen said. &ldquo;She used to work as a therapist before she came here. I guess she missed it, you know, that feeling of helping people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two have been dating for how long now, two years?&rdquo;, asked Jesse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s right, almost two years. We talked about getting married. &quot;</p>
