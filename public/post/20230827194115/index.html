                <p>If conduct matters at all, if we can say there are good actions and bad ones, then there must exist an objective value – an impersonal external system of moral truths that transcend changing human minds and changing material things - that qualifies our judgment of &lsquo;goodness&rsquo;. It is objective in the sense that it does not depend on our opinion or feelings about it for its being.</p>
<p>To speak or think of goodness or lack thereof requires thinking in qualities. We experience quality every day, but our experiences of quality are not isolated. When we begin to think that all value is up to the individual to appraise or invent, we effectively excise ourselves from humanity. If my values are mine, and your values are yours, and there is no commerce between us of impartial ideas we can relate to, there can be no humankind. There is no human condition or basic situation, because humans cannot be qualitatively compared<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Literature would be a huge waste of time because it has nothing to say about <em>me</em> since I didn&rsquo;t write it. If we believe we cannot relate, then sympathy, empathy, history, even communication itself atrophies.  when we take the idea that all value is subjective to its startling and depressing conclusion.</p>
<p>That is the great irony of self-invented value. It seems like total freedom as lack of restriction at the outset. &ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m free to decide what is right and wrong and nobody is going to hold me to their accounting,</em>&rdquo; or some such. This thinking indubitably leads to a kind of total freedom they most likely didn&rsquo;t bargain for: the total freedom of isolation. Like Dostoevsky&rsquo;s Raskolnikov in <em>Crime and Punishment</em>, he believed it was the mark of a superior man to take morality itself in his hands and create his own values to fulfill his vision. Raskolnikov took his inspiration from Napoleon Bonaparte, the capable and ambitious former Emperor of France. Raskolnikov thought that if Napoleon can slaughter thousands to create his idea of the world and his place in it with impunity, then why not him? Why not experiment with one simple murder of an old worthless crone? Since I&rsquo;m a superior man, why not just step on one useless person just to prove the point to myself? This is something only superior men can do. Raskolnikov conducts this &ldquo;experiment&rdquo;, only to find that in the end, the wrongness of the act eventually undoes him. The novel is an epic struggle between misguided intellect and human conscience. In the end he learns that moral individualism is suicide, and he has to atone for his crime.</p>
<p>Obviously not every person who rejects objective value is or will become a murderer of old women. But whether you fancy yourself a superior man like Napoleon in sheer bravado, military prowess, or other competitive skills, or whether, like Nietzsche, you see yourself among a handful of a few valuable people in the century, or whether you see your personal circumstances as unique, so unique that out-dated traditions, books, and institutions cannot relate to you or offer any meaningful answers or come off as heavy-handed or oppressive, there is a common thread: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m special&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that is the end of subjectivism if we take it seriously. It is a doctrine of denial of participation. It is all about exclusivity, of extreme individuality beyond relation. It turns humans from would-be gods into aliens</p>
<p>Freedom from a transcendent view of goodness, justice, wrongness, etc. is freedom from all quality, including the quality of our own subjective experience.
Thanks to objective value, our subjective experiences and feelings do have value. Objective value liberates us by freeing us from the prison of ourselves and providing a network whereupon our subjective experience can have value. It is paradoxical but true, that our liberty lies in our connection. Our freedom to be fully human rests in our common relation not in our individual elevation.</p>
<p>We are subject to it. Objective value means I cannot justly treat you as a means for my selfish purposes because you have value. Objective value is the only sure basis to sustain human dignity from the will of misguided power. As Thrasymachus in Plato&rsquo;s Republic put it: &ldquo;Justice is just the advantage of the stronger&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. If there were no objective value, right would be indistinguishable from might.</p>
<p>But getting back to the idea that there is a Good that qualifies all statements of good. To establish a standard of good, there must be an ultimate good– something than which nothing is better or excelling in perfection. It could not lack goodness. If it did, then something better would displace it. It could not lack knowledge of its perfections (not omniscient) because then it would exist in a state of potentiality. It could potentially learn more, or less, and as such would be subject to one with greater, more complete knowledge. Or perhaps if it lacked the ability, or power to excel to the highest degree (lacking omnipotence), it again will be subject to potential power, not actual power. Hence only a perfect being can establish the standard of good and be The Good itself. As such a perfect being, it must exist in a state of actuality, not potentiality, otherwise it could change, and would cease to be what it is.</p>
<p>This makes sense to me in the abstract, logical sense. But now if we try to apply this principle to everyday objects, we can quickly run into problems. We see a chair. Is it a good chair? Sure. Can I conceive of a better chair? Of course. One more comfortable, perhaps made of a soft leather, not too firm, not too soft. Getting to a <em>better</em> chair for me is not too difficult to conceive. But quickly the idea of a best chair becomes ridiculous. Does this destroy the idea of objective value (as far as chairs go anyway)?</p>
<p>Can we still say that goodness is still relative to the Good? Yes, we can if we locate the good in right action. Going back to our banal chair example: once a chair fulfills its basic purpose: functioning as a stable supportive seat, additional features become subject to personal taste. The realm of taste is not the realm of laws, logic, and demonstration. It is the realm of indulgence, curiosity, and satisfaction of the various interests of every person. Here there is no absolute or universal concept of the good.</p>
<p>So why is it easier to conceive of an infinite spectrum of gradations of quality, building up to a perfect being, but not so for ordinary things, like cars and chairs? I believe it&rsquo;s not a question of limited application, but of knowing the purpose of something. This applies to things and people alike. Once, I was given a set of pens in a swag bag. The pens had a nice rubber-textured grip, thick casing, and looked nice. But every time I opened the cap and went to write, the metal tip just scratched the paper. Only after wetting the tip and a second or two of rolling the tip did it begrudgingly begin to streak navy-blue. Despite its &lsquo;accidentals&rsquo; or superfluous and appealing features, it was and is a bad pen. How can I use such moral and evaluative words like good and bad  about a pen?</p>
<p>It comes back to purpose. I&rsquo;d say the purpose of a pen is to fit comfortably in one&rsquo;s and while inking steadily, on demand. As a tool for a greater end, its good serves higher human ends: the letter, the diary, even the grocery list. These are the <em>oughts</em> of a pen. Despite any other feature, we say it is a bad pen (or chair, car, spatula, etc.) when it fails at these basic purposes. Badness is the most fundamental failure: to contradict one&rsquo;s own being. To fail to be what you are.</p>
<p>For man, it depends on the teleological (purposive) scheme that frames him. Philosophy and religion for millennia have offered various models to frame our ultimate end, and hence what makes us good. Aristotle believed that man&rsquo;s purpose is found in the roles and opportunities unique to us. That is the starting point. Our end lies in fulfilling and discharging our obligations in a way that benefits others and ourselves, this being called happiness. Our end is not attainable in isolation. Man is a social creature, interacting in a web of relationships that generate the roles and opportunities of human life. Extract man from his roles and duties and his function concept, and hence purpose, breaks down entirely.</p>
<p>From Jerusalem, we learn that man was created in the image of God. God set our shape, our form, and our purpose. But thousands of years before Christ and Moses, primordial man took their sense of function and purpose from supra-human sources. Especially for ancient man in polytheistic traditions, it often was many gods, heros, and/or ancestors who revealed man&rsquo;s basic identity, his essential nature, his roles, and his ultimate end. It was primarily a participatory model. Good deeds were so by who originally did them. To do or more likely re-enact the deeds of the great ones was to participate in sacred acts. All that was good had an archetype and model in the myths. The profane and base acts where those without the model, or any innovation against the status quo.</p>
<p>How can man participate in his highest functions, those of the gods? By a repetition of gestures of primordial acts done by the celestial archetypes, sacred patterns of behavior shaped their roles and interactions. Through imitating divine acts, such as creation, building, and conquering evil and chaos, primordial man lived the life of a god, participating in &ldquo;a reality which transcended them.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Models continued to act as standards. Achilles for the warrior of antiquity. Jesus Christ for millions of Christians today. Christ declared himself the new, paradigm-shattering higher model over the Mosaic law when he said: &ldquo;I am the way, the truth, and the life.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come, follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does goodness just depend on the model you choose? Can I make myself my own model, and thus make my whims, my desires, my appetites and instincts the working definition of what is good, true, and beautiful for myself? How could such an isolated scheme really work?</p>
<p>We can tell ourselves that it not only works but is the most true and authentic model to be. After all, we shouldn&rsquo;t try to be like anyone else, just ourselves. We should live out our passions, chase our dreams, and, as Shakespeare&rsquo;s Polonius puts it, &ldquo;&hellip;above all, to thine own self be true.&rdquo;  Yet moral systems cannot be built upon a single person any more than a point is derivable in calculus. Even if the smartest academic were to draw up principles of right and wrong entirely for themselves, with no reference to others actions or ideas, but merely their own actions and impulses, such a system would eventually fill up with, at best, a set of contradictory values being lived in the same person, bringing their net morality to zero. That is if they resist the temptation to regard any desire, regardless of effect on themselves or others, as good in itself since it came from them. But if they were to inquire as to the source of their unending goodness, and what made it so, there could be no answer.</p>
<p>No quality exists in isolation. If that is true, then quality must exist in connection. We have quality as beings who participate in this reality, but we don&rsquo;t invent or establish it. Instead, the fact that qualities exist outside of us makes it possible to know that they exist within us.</p>
<p>Any claim to goodness is referential.
Any goodness in us has its being and reference relative to the Good. &ldquo;Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is, God.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Jesus is using &lsquo;good&rsquo; here not as an adjective but as a noun.</p>
<p>Goodness does not produce Excellence, but rather the other way around. Excellence is a kind of source. Socrates made this point in his Apology:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>_&ldquo;Wealth does not bring about excellence, but excellence makes wealth, and everything else good for men, both individually and collectively&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can mean a number of exciting things. In an economic sense, embracing industriousness, honesty, and discretion inevitability will yield more benefits. But there&rsquo;s more to it than that. If excellence produces not only wealth but <em>all good things</em>, then in a metaphysical sense, all good things come from and are dependent upon that which is best.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s common sense: greater being produces lesser being. It wouldn&rsquo;t make sense the other way around. Again, no quality can exist on its own. Thus all existence happens in a web of relationships of dependency and interdependency.</p>
<p>This idea of a web of relationships is older than Christianity and Greek thought. Hindu and Bhuddist traditions tell of Indra&rsquo;s net. Indra was the supreme deity of the Hindu god-like deities. You can think of him as the Zeus of the Hindu deities. The story goes that he had an artificer construct above his palace a web extending out infinitely in all directions. And at each vertex he had the artificer place a jewel. Not only did the net sparkle like the stars in its infinite dimensions, but each jewel shone with the reflection of all the others in the net. And every jewel reflected in the one is simultaneously reflecting all the others.</p>
<p>Iain McGilchrist puts it well in his latest book <em>The Matter With Things</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Reductionism envisages a universe of <em>things</em> - and simply material things at that. How these things are related is viewed as a secondary matter. However, I suggest that relationships are primary, more foundational than the things related: that the relationships don&rsquo;t just &lsquo;connect&rsquo; pre-existing things, but modify what we mean by the &rsquo;things&rsquo;, which in turn modify everything else they are in relationship with.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relationships make us what we are. And what are we? If humanity has any goodness, and I&rsquo;d say from experience that there is considerable evidence for that, our goodness points back to Excellence, to the Good. That which is superior in degree and kind. That which has the most - is most complete, most whole, most capable, most powerful and, at its core, most good. The Good is inescapably tied in to moral action, and hence a meaningful life.</p>
