      <description>“Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding.”1
 The Allure of Correctness My senior year of high school I fell perhaps too much in love with English. I gained a bit of a reputation as a grammar Nazi. I took a sort of pleasure in catching people when they dangled prepositions, failed on their subject-verb agreements, and said who when they should have said whom.</description>

      <description>Introduction Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s useful to call up a meeting with your personal board of directors when faced with difficult decisions. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll call in a few of mine to see what I can learn about the interplay of commitment and flexibility.
Tolstoy&amp;rsquo;s Young Man with a Big Problem  Nikolai Rostov was a young man with a major dilemma. He was betrothed to his cousin Sonya but he wasn&amp;rsquo;t in love with her.</description>

      <title>How The Mental Models of Orienteering and Topographic Thinking Can Help Us Understand The World</title>

      <description>Introduction Recently, I picked up an old college textbook I&amp;rsquo;d saved, thinking someday I&amp;rsquo;d peruse its pages and maybe get interested in Biology again. Well, the other day I finally did. While reading the introduction, two mental models stood out to me: the mental models of Orienteering and Topographic Thinking.
In this piece, I&amp;rsquo;m going to relate these two models as my professor taught them, and then perhaps in later posts extend it to other concepts and writers.</description>

      <description>Technology offers an interesting set of verbs almost daily: &amp;ldquo;Upgrade&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Sign in&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Create Account&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Buy&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Activate&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Download&amp;rdquo; to name a few off the top of my head. There is always another version. Always more features, fixes and stuff on the digital horizon. We&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be excited, as with the release of a new OS by &amp;ldquo;New experiences. True Connections&amp;rdquo;. Sounds facinating. And if such upgrades aren&amp;rsquo;t imposed upon us, as sometimes they are, we&amp;rsquo;re invited to be excited&amp;hellip; now and always.</description>

      <title>Can Science Really Answer Moral Questions?</title>

      <description>Sam Harris debunked traditional morality in favor of science in a 2010 TED talk entitled “Science can answer moral questions”.
I disagree with Sam Harris that science can answer moral questions.
But first a small preface. My goal is not to criticize unfairly, but attempt to tackle the core of his argument head on, not sidestep to arguments that, though they may be valid, don’t hit his main points. I also want so say that I am not personally attacking Mr.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all relative&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ndash; A relative.
 Demolition brings a draft Five years ago, I decided it was time for spiritual and intellectual remodeling. I was more excited for the demolition than the rebuilding. My faiths and philosophies were flimsy and distorted. And they needed to go. So I picked up my proverbial wrecking bar and went to town. It was my life and I was determined to search for truth on my own.</description>

      <title>How to get up and running with an analog Zettlekästen (slipbox)</title>
      <link>https://www.nathancheever.com/post/zettlekasten/</link>

      <description>Preface There is a veritable plethora of videos and articles on how to setup a digital Zettlekästen. There are tons of blogs and forums about Niklas Luhmann&amp;rsquo;s practice, his prolific publishing record.
So why add another one? Frankly most of them aren&amp;rsquo;t that helpful. I learn by seeing how something is actually done, especially an analog process. And more importantly, I want it to be true to the process Luhmann discovered.</description>

      <title>Questions to be lived</title>
      <link>https://www.nathancheever.com/post/questions/</link>

      <description>Not often, but sometimes, you stumble upon a question that is so profound to you that you would almost be sad to find the answer. It keeps you searching yourself, calling upon something deeper than rote learning or textbook memorization.
Perhaps we can call these “floating questions.” They evade scientific explanation.
Floating questions demand an answer from your life. They can generate enormous passion, send humans into space, and create beautiful art.</description>

      <title>Have a good day, 
Have a good life</title>

      <description>One golden afternoon last October, while taking a walk, I wrote a thought down: &amp;ldquo;Eventually, my life will just be as good as my days. So I need to enjoy my days if I am going to enjoy my life.&amp;quot;
Embedded in there is the idea that no one state or achievement will likely &amp;ldquo;make&amp;rdquo; my life. Instead of some grandiose event, life&amp;rsquo;s quality is subject to more prosaic influences like the quality of our relationships, sleep, self-talk, hobbies, and food.</description>

      <title>Please consider rebelling</title>

      <description>There is a terrible temptation (I know I’ve fallen into many times) to value yourself by your productivity.
The meritocracy culture says monetary accumulation is the gateway to everything we desire: respect, independence, even happiness.
Hearing rhetoric like: “with the internet, not being a millionaire is a choice” for people like me who’ve accomplished very little according to the rules of the game, it can feel absolutely crushing.
Being ordinary is shamed as not hustling hard enough.</description>

      <description>So far, Political Correctness is like other types of correctness in that compliance is key. In particular, compliance in speech. But here again, political correctness cannot mean what I thought it did, because America&amp;rsquo;s Constitution declares freedom of speech a basic right of all citizens. So how could PC mean compliance to the constitution when that standard seeks not to curb free speech but to protect it as a basic right?</description>

      <description>Any discussion of shape and meaning presents a daunting task, especially for the non-expert. This work is the fruit of many hours of pondering, observing, reading, pondering some more, and of course, writing. I hope that it will help you see the world differently. I hope that it will be of some use in how you understand reality. I won&amp;rsquo;t waste your time. I will try to make this as concise and to the point as possible, trying to explain and illustrate but only as much as necessarry.</description>

      <description>Meditations on Shape Everything you see and touch has a shape. It&amp;rsquo;s an elemental property of reality.
Shape is a powerful tool for understanding the world, from biology to chemistry to philosophy. Thinking in shapes will inform your mind and give you clarity.
In fact, the word inform points right back to shape. The Oxford English Dictionary defines inform as &amp;ldquo;to shape the mind or character.&amp;rdquo; It is forming that which is within.</description>

      <description>Order I have talked about the potential of thinking in shapes. Now I ask, what makes a shape?
I have defined a shape as a definite thing. It cannot violate the law of non-contradiction. The triangle can only have three angles and three sides, though those angles and lengths may change, but it cannot simultaneously be a square or a circle.
This constraint denotes an order. This order impels a thing to have boundaries, zones of being and non-being.</description>

      <description>Introduction Five years ago, I decided it was time for spiritual and intellectual remodeling. I was more excited for the demolition than the rebuilding. My faiths and philosophies were flimsy and distorted. And they needed to go. It was my life and I was determined to search for truth on my own.
You see I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what I could trust. I felt deeply betrayed by my church and even my faith.</description>

      <description>Ralph Waldo Emerson  &amp;ldquo;Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness.&amp;rdquo;
 One day in early sprnig I decided to go on a hike. The hike began at my doorstep and I planned to walk across the valley due east until III got into the mountaints.</description>

      <description>There are special times in life to go all out.
Last year, I went all out on a 50-mile hike alone, completing it in 19 hours.
I learned some invaluable lessons like
 Don&amp;rsquo;t trust Google maps over mountains (I got lost) Always pack an extra almond poppyseed muffin. Stopping to rest only makes your legs hurt more.  More importantly, I learned that after being alone and exhausted for hours, all the noise in your head quiets down, and you come to know yourself and your limits.</description>

      <description>Almost 2400 years ago, one of the greatest revolutions the western world has ever known set off.
It was a relatively quiet explosion, not a famous battle or the overthrow of an empire. It was a young man watching his hero, teacher, and mentor put on trial and condemned to death. His teacher had dedicated his life to questioning others, for, as he put it, &amp;ldquo;the unexamined life is not worth living.</description>

      <title>Small Talk as an Onramp</title>

      <description>As an introvert, small talk has never come easy for me. I enjoy watching the occasional football or basketball game. Still, I can&amp;rsquo;t talk at length about the recent trades or injuries.
And the latest on TV or streaming shows? Nope, I&amp;rsquo;m lost. I don&amp;rsquo;t say this to boast, for if anything, it&amp;rsquo;s hindered me in quickly finding common ground in the break room.
Last year, I caught a ride home with a coworker who lived nearby.</description>

      <description>Last October I was walking to lunch with a friend. The Vice-Presidential debate happened the night before, and I glibly remarked about my hopes for the election outcome. Until that moment, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that my friend felt differently.
After about 30 minutes of awkward but polite conversation, it was clear that we disagreed. I tried to mute my sarcasm, but it slipped out once when I said, &amp;ldquo;If Darth Vader pretended to support the policies you supported, would you still vote for him?</description>
