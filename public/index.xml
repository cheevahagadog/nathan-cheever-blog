      <title>How Two Divergent Mental Models of Orienteering and Topographic Thinking Can Help Us Understand The World</title>

      <description>Introduction Recently, I picked up an old college textbook I&amp;rsquo;d saved, thinking someday I&amp;rsquo;d peruse it&amp;rsquo;s pages and maybe get interested in Biology again. Well the other day I finally did. While reading the introduction, two mental models stood out to me. In this piece, I&amp;rsquo;m going to relate these models as my professor taught them, and then extend it to Plato and courage, however, as I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll see, these models have implications beyond Biology and Plato.</description>

      <title>Stoicism-lite</title>

      <description>Much is said and written of Stoicism these days. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it yet, I&amp;rsquo;d be very surprised. Yet, I&amp;rsquo;d be even more surprised if, already familiar with stoicism, you learned about it in school. I sure didn&amp;rsquo;t. &amp;ldquo;Stoic&amp;rdquo; was the name of the dad in How to Train your Dragon, and that didn&amp;rsquo;t give the best impression.
So why is it so popular today, especially if most of us didn&amp;rsquo;t major in philosophy?</description>

      <title>Reading the Classics is Good for your Health</title>

      <description>Reading the classics of the western world might make you healthier, live longer, and happier. The great books are an equal opportunity boon. You can get them over-the-counter at any bookstore, and take at least once daily until you die.
How? This came to me while I was reading some of Plato&amp;rsquo;s dialogues, the Protagoras and the Gorgias. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a randomized trial with a p-value less than five percent showing me this, but there are other strong reasons to believe in the prescription of good reading.</description>

      <title>Protagoras: Praise vs Cheer</title>

      <description>One of my all time favorite quotes is by John Ruskin, who said,
 &amp;ldquo;The greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to see something and tell what it saw in a plain way. Hundreds of people can talk for one who can think, but thousands can think for one who can see.&amp;rdquo;
 Seers are few then, but when they tell what they see in a plain way, their talk is profoundly edifying.</description>

      <description>Technology offers an interesting set of verbs almost daily: &amp;ldquo;Upgrade&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Sign in&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Create Account&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Buy&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Activate&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Download&amp;rdquo; to name a few off the top of my head. There is always another version. Always more features, fixes and stuff on the digital horizon. We&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be excited, as with the release of a new OS by &amp;ldquo;New experiences. True Connections&amp;rdquo;. Sounds facinating. And if such upgrades aren&amp;rsquo;t imposed upon us, as sometimes they are, we&amp;rsquo;re invited to be excited&amp;hellip; now and always.</description>

      <title>Can Science Really Answer Moral Questions?</title>

      <description>Sam Harris debunked traditional morality in favor of science in a 2010 TED talk entitled “Science can answer moral questions”.
I disagree with Sam Harris that science can answer moral questions.
But first a small preface. My goal is not to criticize unfairly, but attempt to tackle the core of his argument head on, not sidestep to arguments that, though they may be valid, don’t hit his main points. I also want so say that I am not personally attacking Mr.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all relative&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ndash; A relative.
 Demolition brings a draft Five years ago, I decided it was time for spiritual and intellectual remodeling. I was more excited for the demolition than the rebuilding. My faiths and philosophies were flimsy and distorted. And they needed to go. So I picked up my proverbial wrecking bar and went to town. It was my life and I was determined to search for truth on my own.</description>

      <title>How to get up and running with an analog Zettlekästen (slipbox)</title>
      <link>https://www.nathancheever.com/post/zettlekasten/</link>

      <description>Preface There is a veritable plethora of videos and articles on how to setup a digital Zettlekästen. There are tons of blogs and forums about Niklas Luhmann&amp;rsquo;s practice, his prolific publishing record.
So why add another one? Frankly most of them aren&amp;rsquo;t that helpful. I learn by seeing how something is actually done, especially an analog process. And more importantly, I want it to be true to the process Luhmann discovered.</description>

      <title>Questions to be lived</title>

      <description>Not often, but sometimes, you stumble upon a question that is so profound to you that you would almost be sad to find the answer. It keeps you searching yourself, calling upon something deeper than rote learning or textbook memorization.
Perhaps we can call these “floating questions.” They evade scientific explanation.
Floating questions demand an answer from your life. They can generate enormous passion, send humans into space, and create beautiful art.</description>

      <description>Call the bluff of stuff.
That 72&amp;quot; TV isn&amp;rsquo;t as advertised. The bluff is a remakable experience. Seeing clearly withyour eyes dramatic or entertaining scences. Yes you could enjoy Casablanca on it, thereis a 1% change you&amp;rsquo;l be happy with it</description>

      <description>One golden afternoon last October, while taking a walk, I wrote a thought down: &amp;ldquo;Eventually, my life will just be as good as my days. So I need to enjoy my days if I am going to enjoy my life.&amp;quot;
Embedded in there is the idea that no one state or achievement will likely &amp;ldquo;make&amp;rdquo; my life. Instead of some grandiose event, life&amp;rsquo;s quality is subject to more prosaic influences like the quality of our relationships, sleep, self-talk, hobbies, and food.</description>

      <description>There is a terrible temptation (I know I’ve fallen into many times) to value yourself by your productivity.
The meritocracy culture says monetary accumulation is the gateway to everything we desire: respect, independence, even happiness.
Hearing rhetoric like: “with the internet, not being a millionaire is a choice” for people like me who’ve accomplished very little according to the rules of the game, it can feel absolutely crushing.
Being ordinary is shamed as not hustling hard enough.</description>

      <description>What is this blog? Everything I write here is written with the intent to learn and explore ideas I find interesting. Maybe you will too! Why do it?:
 Alzheimers runs in my family and I want to keep my mind alive and growing so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t die before I do. I&amp;rsquo;m tired of putting it off. I want to be a better writer and thinker. I want to be an influence for good and pay it forward.</description>

      <description>My Top Books How To Read a Book by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren. The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life by David Brooks The Abolition of Man by C.S. Lewis The Abolition of Man changed my life. After searching for years for solid ground for truth, I finally have a footing thanks to this small book. Lewis shows that there IS objective value; that there is truth and our humanity is bound up with understanding that body of truth which he refers to as the &amp;lsquo;Tao&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>There are special times in life to go all out.
Last year, I went all out on a 50-mile hike alone, completing it in 19 hours.
I learned some invaluable lessons like
 Don&amp;rsquo;t trust Google maps over mountains (I got lost) Always pack an extra almond poppyseed muffin. Stopping to rest only makes your legs hurt more.  More importantly, I learned that after being alone and exhausted for hours, all the noise in your head quiets down, and you come to know yourself and your limits.</description>

      <title>Plato, the moral revolutionary</title>

      <description>Almost 2400 years ago, one of the greatest revolutions the western world has ever known set off.
It was a relatively quiet explosion, not a famous battle or the overthrow of an empire. It was a young man watching his hero, teacher, and mentor put on trial and condemned to death. His teacher had dedicated his life to questioning others, for, as he put it, &amp;ldquo;the unexamined life is not worth living.</description>

      <title>Political Correctness and Respect</title>
      <link>https://www.nathancheever.com/post/political_correctness/</link>

      <guid>https://www.nathancheever.com/post/political_correctness/</guid>
      <description>Just Respect Mobilized? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I know exactly what political correctness (to be referred to by &amp;lsquo;PC&amp;rsquo; from here on out) is. Is it speaking up for the historically marginalized, dispossessed of power? No, I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. That is activism, likely for political rights and status. And activism means expressing point publicly to cause a political or societal change. So I can see how the &amp;lsquo;political&amp;rsquo; aspect of PC can be associated with political activism, standing up for causes and such.</description>

      <title>Small Talk as an Onramp</title>

      <description>As an introvert, small talk has never come easy for me. I enjoy watching the occasional football or basketball game. Still, I can&amp;rsquo;t talk at length about the recent trades or injuries.
And the latest on TV or streaming shows? Nope, I&amp;rsquo;m lost. I don&amp;rsquo;t say this to boast, for if anything, it&amp;rsquo;s hindered me in quickly finding common ground in the break room.
Last year, I caught a ride home with a coworker who lived nearby.</description>

      <description>Last October I was walking to lunch with a friend. The Vice-Presidential debate happened the night before, and I glibly remarked about my hopes for the election outcome. Until that moment, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that my friend felt differently.
After about 30 minutes of awkward but polite conversation, it was clear that we disagreed. I tried to mute my sarcasm, but it slipped out once when I said, &amp;ldquo;If Darth Vader pretended to support the policies you supported, would you still vote for him?</description>
