      <title>Deprivation and Absence</title>

      <description>I stumbled upon a line when reading the other day that got me thinking.
&amp;ldquo;Error is not just an absence, but a deprivation -— the lack of knowledge that somehow ought to be in me.&amp;rdquo;1
Whether error is an absence or privation isn&amp;rsquo;t important to me at the moment, but how well this line highlights the difference between absence and deprivation.
To illustrate the difference, if I say, &amp;ldquo;Mary had a little&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <title>If a thing is worth doing</title>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s the old saying, &amp;ldquo;If a thing is worth doing, it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing well.&amp;rdquo; I, like many of you, was raised on this saying and others like it. &amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;re going to do a job, do it right the first time.&amp;rdquo; That was another of my mom&amp;rsquo;s favorites. These sayings are aiming at doing good work rather than sloppy careless efforts.
If I&amp;rsquo;m going to clean the kitchen, do a good job wiping off the counters, getting the toast crumbs under the toaster, and cleaning out the sink.</description>

      <title>The philosophy of the newspaper</title>

      <description>Introduction Philosophy and &amp;hellip;newspapers!? What could these two totally unrelated things possibly have in common except being antiquated and therefore something I&amp;rsquo;m bound to be interested in? Well, in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered after weeks of intense research about the newspaper: the industry, the product, and the why behind it all (that&amp;rsquo;s where the philosophy comes in!). If you stick around till the end, I&amp;rsquo;ll layout what I think are the keys to using philosophy and some modern adaptations to revitalize the newspaper industry, and perhaps a sense of local community with it.</description>

      <description>The meaning of lines A horizontal line is sensed as &amp;ldquo;being at rest, just as the human body is at rest when horizontal. They give a sense of stability, balance, and tranquility.&amp;rdquo;1
A vertical line is sensed as &amp;ldquo;one of aspiration, reaching, assertiveness&amp;rdquo;2. Instead of the restful equilibrium you see with horizontal lines, we get a dynamic equilibrium. There are forces held in check, just like a human body standing takes lots of muscles to keep it upright, or the strength of a tree&amp;rsquo;s roots holding the tree against the wind.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up reading Blaise Pascal&amp;rsquo;s Pensées lately and this statement made me wonder:
&amp;ldquo;The greater the intellect one has, the more originality one finds in men. Ordinary persons find no difference between men.&amp;rdquo;1
Do you agree?
Intelligence corresponds with an ability to see, perceive, and find things. And not just regular objects, but qualities such as uniqueness, originality, and worth. Failing to see difference in men could mean one is more prone to prejudice and bias.</description>

      <description>The strangest homework assignment I received in college was to go outside after class and burrow into the ground. I did not complete that assignment. The next day my biology professor asked if any of us tried it. Nobody raised their hands. He then explained why. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s because you don&amp;rsquo;t have the right shape for burrowing! But a mole, with their small bodies, their paws and claws, they&amp;rsquo;re quite at home burrowing.</description>

      <description>Today I want to talk to you about philamping and what to pack for it so you&amp;rsquo;re prepared. &amp;ldquo;Phila-what?&amp;rdquo;, I hear you asking. Yes, I made that word up. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing that happens when you&amp;rsquo;re driving across the country in a Uhaul with no radio or smartphone. My mind starts to mash up words. It means philosophical camping. I don&amp;rsquo;t think this term exists, but it ought to, as I&amp;rsquo;ll explain.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Achilles realizes he&amp;rsquo;s not immortal. He grows up. We have a sickness of immortality. You can be whatever you want. It&amp;rsquo;s like playing tennis with the net down. If there are no rules, frankly, then there&amp;rsquo;s no sense of the tragic. There&amp;rsquo;s no sense of the limitations of the human. And without a sense of limitations, funny enough, people become miserable.&amp;rdquo; https://youtu.be/mFWxELAjbyY?t=788

      <title>Marginal Strangeness vs. Total Strangeness</title>
      <link>https://www.nathancheever.com/post/strange_at_second_glance/</link>

      <description>At least 4.6 billion1 people believe they will live on after they die. They believe that somewhere, somehow, their spirit, soul, or essence will persist beyond the grave. However mystical the process, life after death is not a strange idea to them. In fact it is quite familiar and perhaps comforting.
But to that same group the idea of reincarnation – of living again in a different human or animal body – that idea sounds too strange to take seriously.</description>

      <title>Why I Recommend Philosophy</title>

      <description>Mark Twain once said:
&amp;ldquo;Philosophy is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one&amp;rsquo;s lifetime.&amp;rdquo;
Actually, the first word he said was &amp;lsquo;Travel&amp;quot;. Read it again with &amp;ldquo;Travel&amp;rdquo; and you&amp;rsquo;ll see that the two are interchangeable. They&amp;rsquo;re similar in that respect.</description>

      <title>Human Free Will is a Qualitative Reality</title>

      <description>A year ago, free will was freedom to do what I wish. Eating a bowl of delicious honey nut cherrios now or later. Wearing the button down shirt I wore yesterday that doesn&amp;rsquo;t smell bad or a fresh one.
Also, to decide who I will be, my attitudes, my priorities. To be the captain of my soul. That fullness of ability I often neglect yet that can still inspire me. That was free will.</description>

      <description>“Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding.”1
The Allure of Correctness My senior year of high school I fell perhaps too much in love with English. I gained a bit of a reputation as a grammar Nazi. I took a sort of pleasure in catching people when they dangled prepositions, failed on their subject-verb agreements, and said who when they should have said whom.</description>

      <description>Introduction Recently, I picked up an old college textbook I&amp;rsquo;d saved, thinking someday I&amp;rsquo;d peruse its pages and maybe get interested in Biology again. Well, the other day I finally did. While reading the introduction, two mental models stood out to me: the mental models of Orienteering and Topographic Thinking.
In this piece, I&amp;rsquo;m going to relate these two models as my professor taught them, and then perhaps in later posts extend it to other concepts and writers.</description>

True Connections&amp;rdquo;. Sounds fascinating. And if such upgrades aren&amp;rsquo;t imposed upon us, as sometimes they are, we&amp;rsquo;re invited to be excited&amp;hellip; now and always.</description>

      <description>Sam Harris debunked traditional morality in favor of science in a 2010 TED talk entitled “Science can answer moral questions”.
I disagree with Sam Harris that science can answer moral questions.
But first a small preface. My goal is not to criticize unfairly, but attempt to tackle the core of his argument head on, not sidestep to arguments that, though they may be valid, don’t hit his main points. I also want so say that I am not personally attacking Mr.</description>

Demolition brings a draft Five years ago, I decided it was time for spiritual and intellectual remodeling. I was more excited for the demolition than the rebuilding. My faiths and philosophies were flimsy and distorted. And they needed to go. So I picked up my proverbial wrecking bar and went to town. It was my life and I was determined to search for truth on my own.</description>

      <description>Preface There is a veritable plethora of videos and articles on how to setup a digital Zettlekästen. There are tons of blogs and forums about Niklas Luhmann&amp;rsquo;s practice, his prolific publishing record.
So why add another one? Frankly most of them aren&amp;rsquo;t that helpful. I learn by seeing how something is actually done, especially an analog process. And more importantly, I want it to be true to the process Luhmann discovered.</description>

      <description>Not often, but sometimes, you stumble upon a question that is so profound to you that you would almost be sad to find the answer. It keeps you searching yourself, calling upon something deeper than rote learning or textbook memorization.
Perhaps we can call these “floating questions.” They evade scientific explanation.
Floating questions demand an answer from your life. They can generate enormous passion, send humans into space, and create beautiful art.</description>

      <description>One golden afternoon last October, while taking a walk, I wrote a thought down: &amp;ldquo;Eventually, my life will just be as good as my days. So I need to enjoy my days if I am going to enjoy my life.&amp;rdquo;
Embedded in there is the idea that no one state or achievement will likely &amp;ldquo;make&amp;rdquo; my life. Instead of some grandiose event, life&amp;rsquo;s quality is subject to more prosaic influences like the quality of our relationships, sleep, self-talk, hobbies, and food.</description>

      <description>There is a terrible temptation (I know I’ve fallen into many times) to value yourself by your productivity.
The meritocracy culture says monetary accumulation is the gateway to everything we desire: respect, independence, even happiness.
Hearing rhetoric like: “with the internet, not being a millionaire is a choice” for people like me who’ve accomplished very little according to the rules of the game, it can feel absolutely crushing.
Being ordinary is shamed as not hustling hard enough.</description>

We can choose to be something more, and what&amp;rsquo;s more human than that? Death is the ultimate tyrant. Death itself is sin. To cut out a human life when

Jesse parked and shut off the engine and stepped outside. The nursing home seemed even more depressing on a cold grey March Tuesday at 4 pm. Something about the time of day soured his spirits. Heading towards the entrance, through the double sliding doors, he saw that the home was mostly empty. No one was there to greet him. In the reception area were screens playing loops of advertisements.</description>

      <description>The source of good things Where do good things come from? I am reading more Plato lately. I just finished reading The Apology and it was sooo good. One thing Socrates says that struck me was : &amp;ldquo;Do not suppose, men of Athens that wealth makes excellence but that excellence makes wealth and everything else good for men, both individually and collectively.&amp;rdquo;
It&amp;rsquo;s worth reading that again and asking yourself if you agree.</description>

      <description>Respect. When someone says, &amp;ldquo;I ask that you respect my preferences/choice/decision/identity&amp;rdquo;, how are we to respond? Or perhaps more pointedly: &amp;ldquo;why won&amp;rsquo;t you respect my ?&amp;rdquo;. Perhaps the supposition is, if it&amp;rsquo;s someone&amp;rsquo;s choice, it ought to be respected, observed. But what does respect in this case mean? Is it an invitation or an injunction to show admiration and deference to something worthy of those feelings? OED: to treat or regard with deference, esteem, or honor; to feel or show respect for.</description>

      <description>A New Age of Discovery There once was an age of discovery. Names like Christopher Columbus, Magellan, For two hundred years, the Western kingdoms roamed around on ships in search of new lands to colonize or deplete of riches. Literally, the world-view of the West changed rapidly, and history was forever altered.
Now there is a sense that there is nothing left for man to discover on this planet1. Our lands are discovered.</description>

      <description>Welcome! There I was, a programmer and data scientist, who, though I enjoyed code and working with data (and making money) had repressed a passion for reading and learning about history and philosophy for over a decade.
I just landed my first data science job and bought a home. Friends and family told me &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;ve made it&amp;rdquo; but I still felt an intellectual hunger inside I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite place at the time.</description>

      <description>My Top Books How To Read a Book by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren. The Second Mountain: The Quest for a Moral Life by David Brooks The Abolition of Man by C.S. Lewis The Abolition of Man changed my life. After searching for years for solid ground for truth, I finally have a footing thanks to this small book. Lewis shows that there IS objective value; that there is truth and our humanity is bound up with understanding that body of truth which he refers to as the &amp;lsquo;Tao&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Article #13: Is there any value in the Past? Objection 1: It seems there is little value to the past because opportunity for action lies in the present. Since we cannot act in the past, and our purpose is to act rightly in this world, our focus should be on the present. The past holds lessons and data from which we may draw as required to meet our current needs, but the value of the past is defined only by its usefulness to the present and future.</description>

      <description>There are special times in life to go all out.
Last year, I went all out on a 50-mile hike alone, completing it in 19 hours.
I learned some invaluable lessons like
Don&amp;rsquo;t trust Google maps over mountains (I got lost) Always pack an extra almond poppyseed muffin. Stopping to rest only makes your legs hurt more. More importantly, I learned that after being alone and exhausted for hours, all the noise in your head quiets down, and you come to know yourself and your limits.</description>

      <description>If conduct matters at all, if we can say there are good actions and bad ones, then there must exist an objective value – an impersonal external system of moral truths that transcend changing human minds and changing material things - that qualifies our judgment of &amp;lsquo;goodness&amp;rsquo;. It is objective in the sense that it does not depend on our opinion or feelings about it for its being.
To speak or think of goodness or lack thereof requires thinking in qualities.</description>

      <title>Plato, the moral revolutionary</title>

      <description>Almost 2400 years ago, one of the greatest revolutions the western world has ever known set off.
It was a relatively quiet explosion, not a famous battle or the overthrow of an empire. It was a young man watching his hero, teacher, and mentor put on trial and condemned to death. His teacher had dedicated his life to questioning others, for, as he put it, &amp;ldquo;the unexamined life is not worth living.</description>

      <title>Small Talk as an Onramp</title>

      <description>As an introvert, small talk has never come easy for me. I enjoy watching the occasional football or basketball game. Still, I can&amp;rsquo;t talk at length about the recent trades or injuries.
And the latest on TV or streaming shows? Nope, I&amp;rsquo;m lost. I don&amp;rsquo;t say this to boast, for if anything, it&amp;rsquo;s hindered me in quickly finding common ground in the break room.
Last year, I caught a ride home with a coworker who lived nearby.</description>

      <description>Last October I was walking to lunch with a friend. The Vice-Presidential debate happened the night before, and I glibly remarked about my hopes for the election outcome. Until that moment, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that my friend felt differently.
After about 30 minutes of awkward but polite conversation, it was clear that we disagreed. I tried to mute my sarcasm, but it slipped out once when I said, &amp;ldquo;If Darth Vader pretended to support the policies you supported, would you still vote for him?</description>
