      <title>Reading the Classics is Good for your Health</title>

      <description>Reading the classics of the western world might make you healthier, live longer, and happier. The great books are an equal opportunity boon. You can get them over-the-counter at any bookstore, and take at least once daily until you die.
How? This came to me while I was reading some of Plato&amp;rsquo;s dialogues, the Protagoras and the Gorgias. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a randomized trial with a p-value less than five percent showing me this, but there are other strong reasons to believe in the prescription of good reading.</description>

      <description>Technology offers an interesting set of verbs almost daily: &amp;ldquo;Upgrade&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Sign in&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Create Account&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Buy&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Activate&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Download&amp;rdquo; to name a few off the top of my head. There is always another version. Always more features, fixes and stuff on the digital horizon. We&amp;rsquo;re supposed to be excited, as with the release of a new OS by &amp;ldquo;New experiences. True Connections&amp;rdquo;. Sounds facinating. And if such upgrades aren&amp;rsquo;t imposed upon us, as sometimes they are, we&amp;rsquo;re invited to be excited&amp;hellip; now and always.</description>

      <title>Is that True?</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all relative&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ndash; A relative.
 Demolition brings a draft Five years ago, I decided it was time for spiritual and intellectual remodeling. I was more excited for the demolition than the rebuilding. My faiths and philosophies were flimsy and distorted. And they needed to go. So I picked up my proverbial wrecking bar and went to town. It was my life and I was determined to search for truth on my own.</description>

      <title>Questions to be lived</title>
      <link>https://www.nathancheever.com/post/questions/</link>

      <description>Not often, but sometimes, you stumble upon a question that is so profound to you that you would almost be sad to find the answer. It keeps you searching yourself, calling upon something deeper than rote learning or textbook memorization.
Perhaps we can call these “floating questions.” They evade scientific explanation.
Floating questions demand an answer from your life. They can generate enormous passion, send humans into space, and create beautiful art.</description>

      <title>Have a good day, 
Have a good life</title>

      <description>One golden afternoon last October, while taking a walk, I wrote a thought down: &amp;ldquo;Eventually, my life will just be as good as my days. So I need to enjoy my days if I am going to enjoy my life.&amp;quot;
Embedded in there is the idea that no one state or achievement will likely &amp;ldquo;make&amp;rdquo; my life. Instead of some grandiose event, life&amp;rsquo;s quality is subject to more prosaic influences like the quality of our relationships, sleep, self-talk, hobbies, and food.</description>

      <title>Please consider rebelling</title>

      <description>There is a terrible temptation (I know I’ve fallen into many times) to value yourself by your productivity.
The meritocracy culture says monetary accumulation is the gateway to everything we desire: respect, independence, even happiness.
Hearing rhetoric like: “with the internet, not being a millionaire is a choice” for people like me who’ve accomplished very little according to the rules of the game, it can feel absolutely crushing.
Being ordinary is shamed as not hustling hard enough.</description>

      <title>Moderation in moderation</title>

      <description>There are special times in life to go all out.
Last year, I went all out on a 50-mile hike alone, completing it in 19 hours.
I learned some invaluable lessons like
 Don&amp;rsquo;t trust Google maps over mountains (I got lost) Always pack an extra almond poppyseed muffin. Stopping to rest only makes your legs hurt more.  More importantly, I learned that after being alone and exhausted for hours, all the noise in your head quiets down, and you come to know yourself and your limits.</description>

      <title>Small Talk as an Onramp</title>
      <link>https://www.nathancheever.com/post/talk/</link>

      <description>As an introvert, small talk has never come easy for me. I enjoy watching the occasional football or basketball game. Still, I can&amp;rsquo;t talk at length about the recent trades or injuries.
And the latest on TV or streaming shows? Nope, I&amp;rsquo;m lost. I don&amp;rsquo;t say this to boast, for if anything, it&amp;rsquo;s hindered me in quickly finding common ground in the break room.
Last year, I caught a ride home with a coworker who lived nearby.</description>

      <description>Last October I was walking to lunch with a friend. The Vice-Presidential debate happened the night before, and I glibly remarked about my hopes for the election outcome. Until that moment, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that my friend felt differently.
After about 30 minutes of awkward but polite conversation, it was clear that we disagreed. I tried to mute my sarcasm, but it slipped out once when I said, &amp;ldquo;If Darth Vader pretended to support the policies you supported, would you still vote for him?</description>
