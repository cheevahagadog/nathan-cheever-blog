      <description>Introduction Recently, I picked up an old college textbook I&amp;rsquo;d saved, thinking someday I&amp;rsquo;d peruse its pages and maybe get interested in Biology again. Well, the other day I finally did. While reading the introduction, two mental models stood out to me: the mental models of Orienteering and Topographic Thinking.
In this piece, I&amp;rsquo;m going to relate these two models as my professor taught them, and then perhaps in later posts extend it to other concepts and writers.</description>

      <description>Sam Harris debunked traditional morality in favor of science in a 2010 TED talk entitled “Science can answer moral questions”.
I disagree with Sam Harris that science can answer moral questions.

      <description>Preface There is a veritable plethora of videos and articles on how to setup a digital Zettlekästen. There are tons of blogs and forums about Niklas Luhmann&amp;rsquo;s practice, his prolific publishing record.
So why add another one? Frankly most of them aren&amp;rsquo;t that helpful. I learn by seeing how something is actually done, especially an analog process. And more importantly, I want it to be true to the process Luhmann discovered.</description>

      <description>Almost 2400 years ago, one of the greatest revolutions the western world has ever known set off.
It was a relatively quiet explosion, not a famous battle or the overthrow of an empire. It was a young man watching his hero, teacher, and mentor put on trial and condemned to death. His teacher had dedicated his life to questioning others, for, as he put it, &amp;ldquo;the unexamined life is not worth living.</description>
