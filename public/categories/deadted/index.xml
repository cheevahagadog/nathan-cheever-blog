      <description>NOTES FOR THE READER:
I’ve tried to imagine him on a stage and added cues for how I imagine him saying things, pausing at times, etc. As I’ve pulled together fragments across his book “The Gay Science”, sometimes I abbreviate with ‘&amp;hellip;’. These are not to be read as a dramatic pause, but more to indicate that I’ve skipped some of his words. I’ve tried to keep Nietzsche’s italicization&amp;rsquo;s. My words/edits I’ve tried to keep to a minimum and they are indicated in blue (coming soon).</description>
