One of my all time favorite quotes is by John Ruskin, who said, 
> "The greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to see something and tell what it saw in a plain way. Hundreds of people can talk for one who can think, but thousands can think for one who can see." 

Seers are few then, but when they tell what they see in a plain way, their talk is profoundly edifying.

 When I think of 'seers' one person who comes to mind is Socrates. Socrates was questioning the most famous thinker and sophist in Greece, and the first to charge for his services, Protagoras.
Socrates' questions are lethal to bias and flat opinion. And as Socrates began to confound Protagoras, Protagoras resorts to lengthening his speeches and trying to win applause.

Prodicus, himself a sophist and an onlooker, pipes up as it looks like the discussion is going to fall apart.
He advises Socrates and Protagoras to continue the debate, but to "dispense with the eristics".

Eristics means a disputatious or contentious bearing in debate. The tools of this trade are scorn, accusations, fast talk, appeals to vanity and even unsupported opinion. 
Winning points to gain praise is great for the ego, but Prodicus pleas with them to aim for a higher goal.

Prodicus himself gives a short speech contrasting such praise with good opinion. 
Praise can often be a 'deceitful verbal expression', a chest-thumping and thoughtless thing, which appeals to ego.
Good opinion is intrinsically felt "in the souls of the listeners".
 You may not know to clap because what you heard is working inside you still.

Such plain telling produces an effect Prodicus calls 'cheering'.
 Cheering is to participate in an intellectual exercise and thus be raised to a higher mental state.
 When one is cheered, they're educated, edified, and settling into a new viewpoint.

This made me think of how Jesus in the New Testament at times urged his disciples to "be of good cheer", almost as an invitation to come along with him and overcome fear.

Telling what you see in a plain way can cheer people's souls. Move them from a limited view of the world and themselves to a higher plane. It's participating in a rigorous but delightful intellectual journey.
Reading or listening to those who saw they don't want our claps but our welfare. They plainly pass along their clarity, and as Socrates says in Plato's _Gorgias_:
> "That it should become clear is a good common to all"

Clarity is a good. 
Finishing the quote from John Ruskin:
> "To see clearly is poetry, prophecy and religion, all in one."
