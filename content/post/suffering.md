Brain dump
=======
Randolph Bourne wrote about an inner santuary - a safe haven inside. So did Viktor Frankl. His was a personal transcendance over the gloom and horror of the concentration camps. He was searching for something and found it.
MA also talks about it -- looking within finding a spring of goodness. Up (Frankl) and down (MA)
MA also tells himself to not retreat into himself and to be kind to those around him.
Meister Eckhart talks about a place within us still pure and unadultarated, an inner santuary.

Ok so a bunch of old dead guys believe in the value of an inner-santuary, an inner-life. WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA WORTH SHARING HERE?

Rough draft
========
Over a hundred years ago, [Randolph Bourne]() wrote about how despite one's poor circumstances and physical health, one can 
> "occupy the far richer kingdom of mental effort and artistic appreciation."

He discovered his real handicap was cowardice and lack of responsibility for one-self. Allowing himself to be deprived of the "stimulus" of conscious choice and action was the greatest disability. His conscious choice to be alive was the beginning of his history.

One's inward life can deepen and grow despite crushing circumstances. Although a victim of the holocaust and separated from his family, Viktor Frankl describes transcending the oppressive grey gloom of his life till he could commune with his wife.

Evil and disaster could not erase meaning. He had to muster his courage for the spiritual exercise of transcending over and into the transcendent, and feel a kind of joy.

David Brooks describes this as transcendent joy - where we feel a feeling of oneness or union with "nature, the universe or God." We are enveloped in a unity so that all sense of 
boundary becomes blurry. Brooks says the boundaries dissolve, perspectives are altered and we feel the light as we move toward it.

But not all goodness is above, out there, somewhere. In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius counsels himself to "look within" and find the wellspring of goodness within him. All he need do is dig.

Digging, like climbing involves an exercise to access a higher perspective or unity or uncover truth and treasure. Getting to the good within and losing oneself require an active pursuit, not idle resignation.

Aurelius chose his words poetically. He wanted his soul to be a spring and not a well.

He comparies a spring to a well. Both come from beneath and provide water. But the latter is stagnant and easily pollutable. It's inherently reactive, taking whatever falls within it and only giving out water when drawn out. Instead, he wants to be like the spring: insult it, and nothing happens. Throw dirt in it, and it instantly cleans itself by continuously issuing out clean potable water.

Aurelius counsels himself to be the spring through deliberate and regular spiritual exercise: 
> _"forming thyself hourly to freedom conjoined with contentment."_ 

What a lovely description of a spring.

But where does this good come from? C.S. Lewis devotes a book to answering where the source of good and human values lies in _The Abolition of Man_. 
> _"There's a place in the soul that neither time nor space nor no created thing can touch."_

Despite suffering, physical handicap, abuse or what have you, Lewis claims that there's a place within us that is pure, unadulterated and true. It's part of what makes us the kinds of beings that can recognize goodness, truth, and beauty naturally, like recognizing the sound of our mothers voice.

All materials have a natural frequency. When a sound is made at that same frequency it amplifies the waves of the object with that same natural frequency. Hence the trope of the loud singer breaking the crystal glass. It wasn't her high pitch that broke it, it was the same internal pitch as the glass that caused the shatter. Perhaps this piece of divine stuff is what resonates inside us and makes us, in Lewis' words, "the kinds of things we are."

"The kinds of things we are" brings us back at last to Marcus Aurelius. He is known as one of the main Stoic philosophers, though what we have of his writings were meant for himself only. His Meditations are often described as a repetition of mental tools and crutches for helping him under the burden of emperor of the known world. Definitely, his practices and mantras do seem purely practical, but the core of his stoicism rested in his belief in a universal nature. 

To Aurelius, the universal nature touched everything and everyone. It not only made man but gave all _things_ (including us) their nature and their relation to each other. To break against this nature was the ultimate injustice, the ultimate impiety. To sin against truth itself.

These men come from different times and backgrounds.
 Yet they are united in belief that there is truth.
 That truth and goodness are the natural order of the universe, and if we were created from it (either by God or in some other way) we are children of truth and goodness.
 It's within us and envelops us even in desparate times.
 Goodness is the most enduring quality of what is.
