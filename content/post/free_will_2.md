This is the second part in an intermittent series on [free will].

## The headlock of physics
Framing free will in terms of determinism creates a problem.
 If determinism means there is no randomness, only perfectly predictable cause and effect, it leaves no room for a conscious choice.
Some physicists point to the uncertainty inherent in quantum mechanics [ref to Michio](), and at least to me, the difficulty with predictability of subatomic particles doesn't make me feel any freer. If it's an either or between determinism and randomness, randomness isn't freedom either.

For [Ned Block]() this means the idea of free will is badly framed, not allowing free choice anywhere between those two limits.
