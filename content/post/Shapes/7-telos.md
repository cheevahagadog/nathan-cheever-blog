### The presupposition
How can we know what the difference is between evolution and destruction? To do this we must have an idea of the final cause or purpose of the thing.

A house undergoing renovation to become earthquake-resistant is a good conformity. A house destroyed after an earthquake is a bad conformity. The first furthers the telos or purpose of the thing, that is to be a safe and nice place to live. The second breaks not only the shape but the telos. An unlivable house is a blight, a thing dangerous to the life it was previously protecting.

To think effectively about purpose, we can employ our shape-thinking.

------------------------
What is the purpose of a hammer? It's purpose is to drive and pull nails. How do I know this? It is the best single thing I know of that can do both and very well. Its shape points to purpose through use. 
A hammer can be utilized for a number of other jobs: paperwieght, or even spatulla.
Shape is a purpose dictionary. Many words in the dictionary have various definitions, often hovering around a central concept. 
A thing's shape, and its enclosed order, patterns, limitations, act as a sort of dictionary for a things meaning.
The meaning of a word is the purpose of a word. When we know that, we know it when it used and when to use it, just like we would a hammer.

-------------------------â€”
Like all wisdom, conformity wisdom requires that I know who  I am, what I am.
It is knowing our order, and our limits.
To know our order, to know what our life _means_ means we know what our purpose is.

Whatever thing you are, be a good one.

A rock unearthed from a hole cannot be said to be deformed. It simply is a rock. That same rock can be sculpted into a pillar for a temple. Now it has a purpose, a _telos_. It has been given a new order. A new shape has formed and the once non-descript rock now has a definite purpose.
