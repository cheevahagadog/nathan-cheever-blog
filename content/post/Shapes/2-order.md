### Order
I have talked about the potential of thinking in shapes. Now I ask, what makes a shape? 

I have defined a shape as a definite thing. It cannot violate the law of non-contradiction. The triangle can only have three angles and three sides, though those angles and lengths may change, but it cannot simultaneously be a square or a circle.

This constraint denotes an order. This order impels a thing to have boundaries, zones of being and non-being. Order is the starting point for all things.

Order is inherent in all patterns. A pattern relies on repetition of a property or figure. From order and patterns we can inform ourselves of meaning.

Order is the stuff of meaning. 
Grammatical order yields the possibility for semantic meaning. Patterns yield the possibility of intentional meaning. Structured stories yield the possibility of a moral lesson or insight.

### Meaning
Can meaning be extracted from randomness? No. To be random is the opposite of ordered. It is to have no definite arrangement, aim or pattern. It is flux without purpose, a void with no reason. We may say it has no order and therefore no shape. From this irregular, confused, or deranged dark matter the only thing to conclude is that it is.

Meaning can only grow from order and patterns, but not all patterns readily yield meaning. Linear B or other undecipherable languages, clearly have an order, but the metaphorical link whereby one known context could inform the other, via translation, has been lost. We need bridges or maps from one order to another.

A pattern or order can only have meaning through interpretation, perception and/or experience. Some patterns are lost on some while sensed by others. To the former, unable or unwilling to see, there is nothing but the void. They look elsewhere. Yet the latter find material for meaning.

Making connections is refreshing and exciting. Being informed one is shaped and molded. Understanding is _refined_, that is, altered by removal of impurities or inferior qualities. The contours become more crisp and stark. One knows one's environment better and is better suited for navigating life.

This enlightenment is not quite to perceive a grand oneness or universality but rather the sacred and essential discreteness of beings. To see order is to see limits.

### Limits
In all I have said so far of order, being the bedrock of meaning, I have neglected to describe the essence of order. It is limitation and discreteness. Like I said before, a shape cannot violate the law of non-contradiction. No intelligible thing can be itself and have no limits. So the essence of order depends upon an arrangement of finite parts to form a discernible shape. 

True randomness, having no order, has no limits. We cannot tell it what it can and cannot be. It knows no agreements, respects no contracts. It is mere chaos.

What we do hold to have an order, that which proceeds with a pattern, reason or aim, must be inherently limited. It must halt from encroaching upon boundaries that would make it what it is not. Otherwise it must slip into chaos.

### Rationality
Humans are called the rational animals. I do not dispute that. I am grateful for and cherish our rationality, and our potential for rationality. Yet, many are painfully aware that by-and-large we fall short of our endowment of exercising reason. We might think that it is we, not rationality itself, that is limited. And we certainly are limited. But rationality is like a bicycle. One can learn to use it to transport themselves across vast distances (and do it fast!). But despite the physical fitness of the rider, there are places where a bike cannot go. So it is with rationality â€“ our unique ability to reason. Because it is rooted in order it can only grow so high.
