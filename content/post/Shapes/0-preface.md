## Ball or Block?

For any given subject, to presume to write a book of any length assumes some level of expertise. When writing about shapes, no degree is necessary. But this is not a book _just_ about shapes. My intention is not to elaborate basic geometry, talking about solids, planes, and the different types of shapes. Yet familiarity with shapes is needed. The intuition of why we use spheres for sports instead of using squares is at the same time obvious and illuminating. Even if both objects, the sphere and the square, are made by the same person, with the same material, the same color, if every physical and aesthetic property of them were identical in all respects, the sphere is unquestioningly preferred for sports. Why?

This question is obvious – because a ball can roll with ease and a square cannot with ease. There is an implied 'job to be done', a purpose to serve behind our intuition in choosing a ball over a block. Or even the size, roughness, material of a ball! The closer we look at shape, the more the idea of a 'telos' or purpose presents itself to us. And with these disclosures of purpose, shape and being are unavoidable components of inquiry.

Deliberate design is no accident. Beyond playing sports or studying geometry, we are faced with jobs to be done constantly. The water bottle, the table, the hammer, the knife: how often do we stop to notice how closely tied the _shape_ of it is tied to _what_ it is? No one has heard of a round knife, because that would contradict _what a knife is_. So far this all seems obvious, and if these observations were confined to everyday objects, then I wouldn't have felt compelled to write any more. Yet in my reading, thinking, and observations I've seen this elementary intuition at the heart of many pressing issues – issues seen as highly complex, highly volatile or political, s

In this book, I want to take a hard look at the idea of shape – not just in the physical world but the world of human experience and thought. I've noticed the same intuition we have of physical shapes informs abstract shapes. I've also noticed that certain ways of thinking produce absurd consequences for thought, when we abuse and disregard this common-sense/basic logic of abstract shapes in human experience. The outcomes of thinking this way in the physical world would be disasterous, and yet just because we don't see it in a physical way, so too does thinking this way create problems for our human experience. It is the aim of this book to build a bridge of thinking about the language and logic of shapes in a way that translates faithfully from the world of spheres, planes, and houses, to the world of identity, character, and being. 

I hope that it will help you see the world differently. I hope that it will be of some use in how you understand reality.
I won't waste your time. I will try to make this as concise and to the point as possible, trying to explain and illustrate but only as much as necessary.
