# Meditations on Shape

Everything you see and touch has a shape. It's an elemental property of reality.

Shape is a powerful tool for understanding the world, from biology to chemistry to philosophy. Thinking in shapes will inform your mind and give you clarity.

In fact, the word _inform_ points right back to shape. The Oxford English Dictionary defines inform as "to shape the mind or character." It is _forming_ that which is within. From E. B. White we see this relationship again: "Writers do not merely reflect and interpret life, they inform and shape life."

To be informed is to be shaped by an idea. 

This pedestrian word, inform, comes from the Latin _informare_ meaning to mould, shape, fashion in the mind. This process used to be called information: the process of forming the mind.[^1] Now, the meaning has shifted away from the process of forming to the idea, fact or knowledge being communicated. But _inform_, as a word still points to a change wrought within you.

The language of shape hides in plain sight in everyday language. We might complain of formalities (that which pertains to the outward form or shape or appearance) or understand essences with Aristotle's formal cause.

Shape is an important concept in the natural sciences. The phenotype of an organism, the structure of a molecule, the angle of a ramp, the graph of a function. Shape is more than a two-dimensional outline. It means the essential quality of a thing, its form, contours and properties.

Shape is also an important concept in philosophy. When we speak of character, we might think of how someone is known. The word comes from Greek meaning a person or instrument that engraves or impresses. Letters are characters - engraven figures.

When we shape something, we create a new thing. When we erase or dull or mangle the contours of a shape, we destroy what was. We do it with pumpkins on Halloween, food, constantly creating new and destroying old by altering shapes.

But how are shapes possible?
