# Meditations on Shape

Everything you see and touch has a shape. It's an elemental property of reality. Shape is an essential to what a thing is.
Shape exists as an essence, both in the mind and in the physical world.

Shape is a powerful tool for understanding the world, from biology to chemistry to philosophy. Thinking in shapes will inform your mind and give you clarity.

To be informed is to be shaped by an idea. And this is of the utmost importance. We are being massaged by ideas constantly. Through advertising, media, videos, writing, these can and do exert an influence on the shape of our thoughts. Where the mind goes eventually the body will follow. What is shaped outwardly was first shaped within.

The language of shape hides in plain sight in everyday language.
### Hiding in plain sight
May I inform you of something?
Did you know that the word _inform_ comes from the Latin _informare_ meaning to mould, shape, fashion in the mind. This process used to be called information: the process of forming the mind.[^1] Now, the meaning has shifted away from the process of forming to the idea, fact or knowledge being communicated.
There, you have been informed. 
Your brain, whether ever so minutely in a physical sense, but much more in a mental sense, has been shaped by learning. This relatively pedestrian word  points to a shape, to the change in shape wrought within you. The Oxford English Dictionary defines inform as "to shape the mind or character." It is _forming_ that which is within.[^2]

As a verb, to shape means to form, like a river shaping a canyon. When we shape something, we create a new thing. When we erase or dull or mangle the contours of a shape, we destroy what was. 

But what about things that remain what they are even when their shape is changed? Surely a change in a shape isn't the same as the destruction of a thing? Is a person putting on winter clothes to keep warm against the cold, and thus changing her shape, a destruction of that person? Is a melting piece of wax no longer wax? Is smoushed bread not bread? All liquids are shapeless in the physical sense, only taking the shape of their container. Are they not things?

If I took this literal meaning of the word shape as the physical dimensions of things, this would be an obstacle. I mean to use shape as synonymous with the word form – the manner of being of things. I believe it is this working definition of shape that the word is used in the colloquial examples above. Projects are often not physical objects. A team, a household, our fantasy football teams, they aren't known by their physical shapes, like, say candlesticks or soccer balls, yet they too are immersed in the language and logic of the word shape. Why is that?

The language of shape appears in the natural sciences. The phenotype of an organism, the structure of a molecule, the angle of a ramp, the graph of a function. 

I've noticed it crop up as an important concept in philosophy. When we speak of character, we might think of how someone is known. The word comes from Greek meaning a person or instrument that engraves or impresses. Letters are characters - engraven figures. Plato considered geometry a gateway to the realm of absolute truth, the realm of the Forms.

The language and logic of shape hides in the background of every conversation.
We complain of formalities (that which pertains to the outward form or shape or appearance).
We talk about edge-cases for projects or logic.
We talk about our personal boundaries or lack thereof.
How one's fantasy football team is shaping up. Staying in shape over the holidays. Or a new building taking shape. Or a house being in bad shape after an earthquake. Even a day might have a shape by its routine.

What unifies these various usages of the language and logic of shape across so many domains?
Building on what we know about the basics of shapes, can we extend our understanding of all the things that have this concept available to them?

My thoughts lead me to find some of the main points of this logic and language of shape. It started with the most fundamental components of what makes a shape, and then extended out through how we think in shapes.

This short work is an attempt to explore words and ideas looking for meaning. Most of these words are commonplace but when traced back to their meanings, create a network of thought that creates an outline for understanding shape.
Words like form, boundaries, order, character, conformity, randomness, meaning, and even purpose form (to use that word) a vocabulary for understanding shape.
Shape language is pervasive because it is more than talking about a two-dimensional outline or geometry. It grasps at the essential quality of a thing, its form, contours and properties.


But how are shapes possible?
