# Afterword

This book has been a joint-exploration. I didn't always know where it was going to go, but there seemed to be a truth worth pursuing and discussing. The language and thinking of shapes is so ubiquitous that I needed and wanted to look into what might connect it. How does it hang together and make sense? 

If there were a few takeaways for me on this journey they would be:


1. Shape is not an idle metaphor. The terms and logic of shape apply to physical things as well as non-physical things.
2. Limits make order possible. Order is the essence of patterns. Patterns make life intelligible by disclosing meaning. 
3. Everything that is intelligble has an order, and as such is limited.
4. We too, have an order, a pattern, and limits. They can change though. Life is a series of shapings into a distinct individual or character, or a specter â€“ the mere physical form of a human.
5. Shape and being are tightly linked. To alter, conform, or deform a shape is a change of being. 
6. There are forces that can do this to us, especially on the inside. We ought to take full responsibility for seeking our true nature and conforming ourselves to it.
7. To know our essental nature depends on a telos, a model or destination of what we can be. Without one no meaning is possible.
8. To reach into the limitless, our limited tools will not work. To understand God we must first understand the shape of reason, its limitations and function, before seeing the proper shape of God.
