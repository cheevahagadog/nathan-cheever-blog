## Character
The word "character" can mean different things in different contexts. In one, it might be an actor on a stage playing a part. In another, a character might refer to a marking, a letter or symbol that carries linguistic or even artistic weight. In common parlance it refers to how someone is known.

David Brooks, in his book _The Road to Character_ defines it as:
> "as a set of dispositions, desires, and habits that are slowly engraved during a struggle against your own weakness."

The word comes from Greek meaning to engrave, or carve. Engraven letters were known as characters, like alphanumeric characters.
Character is the shape of our lives. Character is the distinctive mark by which we are known.

According to Kierkegaard, "morality is character"[^1] and our character is manifest as a real "engraven" thing. He compares "abstract common sense" to the sea and the sand, lacking a definite shape and devoid of character. And since it is devoid of character, it is morally vacant because it lacks an essential inwardness and energy. The sea and the sand _characterize_ churning, rumination, and as Kierkegaard would call it "reflection".

For Kierkegaard, decisive action was key to being somebody; to having a character. This character could be a villan or a hero, but one cannot be either without unambiguous and passionate action one way or another.

This takes us to the use of the word "character" as an actor on a stage. As such, characters furnish us with examples of moral ideals. They embody and live out "moral beliefs, doctrines, and theories"[^2]. Their action shows the audience the plausibility or implausibility of a way of life.
Embodiment of belief means actions on a stage that accord to those beliefs. A character is not someone who is a little of this, a little of that, no definite aims, struggles, passions. Of course, characters like this appear, but they are there to illustrate a lack of character, a mere prop and flat plot piece, not a decisive passionate center of responsible action.

Characters as such can be vicious, greedy, hateful, and brutal and still be characters. They can also be magnanimous, loving, and pure. The qualifying criterion of a character is not an agreed upon set of virtues. It is an embodiment of distinct moral (or immoral) beliefs and values. As the body is made for action, embodiment of character denotes action.

The core of character is genuineness. Actually and sincerely being inwardly what is characterized outwardly. To be or have character one must act free from pretense. 

The two parts of human character are genuineness and action. With genuineness only but no action, as for example someone sitting at home watching TV passing judgement on current events with the purist virtue and wisdom is only half. Likewise action unconvinced of its purpose and intents or stuck in endless enervating reflection is incomplete. These two parts together create boldness. The boldness of convinced action is what forms character.
Action serves as a model or a definition of the genuine beliefs. Embodiment engraves inward ideas with outward deeds.

This is an affirmation of the value of bold action, for it is not the outcome or result that justifies or forms character. Rather it is the essential inwardness coupled with action. Failure in outcome is beyond the boundary of character. Results are the ramifications of the choices of a character and bear the record of what the character is, but they do not form it. All strong character is bold and a definite something.

Could we even conceive of or find values like honesty, loyalty, or bravery if there were not characters to personify them? Where would we find them? Certainly nature is mysterious, full of force, expansive wonder and capable of profound inspiration. Could honesty be depicted in a landscape? Or in a waterfall? It is only in human beings that these qualities can be found. [^3]

The undoing of character is the undoing of its parts. Lack of consistent action makes belief imperceptible. Hypocrisy of inward and outward modes of being destroy all character, whether virtuous or vice. It is an erasing, an abuse of shape. It is a letter "_A_" becoming lowered, unbolded, and finally erased. 

This is crudeness in action. If action continues without genuineness it becomes a sham. It's perfunctory, meaningless and arbitrary. A robot could do it. Kierkegaard called this 'crudeness', when that inward, essential passion driving force is smothered or discouraged within someone, that "one motivation"[^4] rubbed out. It is a failure to be a self.

A life devoid of the essential animating principle of passion loses meaning, the "why" for it's existence. But what does the loss of meaning mean? It is the loss of a why, a logical yet not merely logical order to one's life. For no meaning can come where there is no order.  Endless reflection, endless equivocation, waffling back and forth is not moral. It is the resistance to taking a shape; to becoming definite. 

Of course such a person can carry on in some orders. Getting up, dressing, going to work, picking up the groceries, essentially, sleepwalking through life. This is Kierkegaard's idea of crudeness. The shell of an order persists that yields no meaning other than the meaning to keep repeating itself, like a pattern for no point. Such a life is an inscrutable pattern, even and especially to himself. Life becomes an ever-darkening mystery. An endless dress-rehearsal, a pile-up of potential unadorned by action.

When one loses the hunger for certainty inside themselves and takes precepts at face-value or are indifferent or hostile to their beliefs, this is a loss of an intellectual conscience[^5]. Not doubt but not even to question, to wonder but to live a life of auto-pilot is an injustice to the wonders of reality.

It is therefore character, that combination of genuineness and action that makes life legible in the first-person sense. When life is legible, discernable through the passionate impressions of a character, there is no present uncertainty of what one is about or why. A person is truly a 'self' in a world of averages. It is this essential passion that acts as a link to the transcendent, cutting above the meaningless world of mere objects, making man truly free and responsible at once. Perhaps there is no freedom without an essential passion.

From the inner clarity of what one must be, their genuineness, their actions follow. Their values and principles create the priorities for action.
A pious character might say to himself, "Before anything else, I must pray to God." The same character might think that seeking worldly riches "doesn't matter that much." 
Clear priorities are the offspring of a clear understanding of what one values and who one is. Priorities become clear when our values are, and it is then that character boundaries manifest most strongly. The character makes clear the kinds of talk, deeds, appointments he will and will not  engage in. His reasons are clear and his life, embodying the values, manifest the values to his audience. This unity of purpose, desire, and action create an electric unity and integrity.
Such a person is a true character â€“ a value and passion manifest. Their life as a character becomes the shape of the idea. 
Facts, figures, and evidence won't always convince someone else of an unappealing concept. But combine an abstract concept, such as wholehearted devotion with a person we care for, then that person becomes the best argument for that idea.[^6]

To be a physical person is easy enough. To be a particular kind of person requires character.

Nature has fulfilled its part. It is wondrous, wild and full of qualities. To be a self one must respond to the call of Nature and become a character. To live life fully alive, full of genuineness and action.
