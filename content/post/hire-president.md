One golden afternoon last October, while taking a walk, I wrote a thought down: 
_**"Eventually, my life will just be as good as my days. So I need to enjoy my days if I am going to enjoy my life."**_

Embedded in there is the idea that no one state or achievement will likely "make" my life. Instead of some grandiose event, life's quality is subject to more prosaic influences like the quality of our relationships, sleep, self-talk, hobbies, and food.

While this might sound rather boring, it's actually quite reassuring that the requirements are so low. I don't need fame or glory or a Rolls Royce (though that would be nice). I already have everything and more that I need, and I receive more daily. 

So, past a certain point of living comfort, the quality of my life isn't going to be determined by my address, car, or other possessions.

And if we try to make every day special, they really aren't special. They'll mostly be ordinary. 

So we need to embrace our ordinary days. There will be special days, no doubt, but we shouldn't hinge it all on them. 

If the ordinary days are less than satisfying, **you just elevate your ordinary**. Pick your favorite approach for doing that.

**Days are the units of life.**

"Eventually, my life will just be as good as my days. So I need to enjoy my days if I am going to enjoy my life."
