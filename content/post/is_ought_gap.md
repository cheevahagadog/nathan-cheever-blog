David Hume was pretty anti-causation. He didn't like people jumping from an observation about how things are to making statements about how they should be.
This because known as the "Is/Ought Gap" or "Is/Ought Fallacy": that assuming or asserting that because a certain state of affairs _is_ a certain way that they _should_ be that way. It could be the opposite as well: If something is not happening now, asserting that it _should_ not occur also falls under this fallacy.

Hume teaches that statements about what _is_ involves a different set of reasoning than setting out an _ought_. For Hume, facts don't speak to us and tell us what to do. That comes from us, not what _is_.  Hume wants us to stop pulling values, or oughts, out of states of being. One is practical reason, the other speculative reason.

### Reasons I agree with Hume
1. Hume is right in pointing out that there is a gap in switching from one kind of reasoning to another without justification
2. It is dubious to use scientific fact as a reason for values, pretending 
3. From a scientific perspective, we cannot get moral maxims from scientific observations

### Reasons I disagree with Hume
1. Oughts are 

Hume is pointing out an intellectual error: we don't get shoulds from looking in a microscope. Or in looking at a landscape, or in the natural world. 

Think about that for a minute. Ultimately, Hume is arguing that the realm of facts have no value. 

Hume has a great point, and he's trying to keep us from making an intellectual error. And an intellectual error it may be, but is it actually the right thing to do in a higher sense?

For Hume to be totally correct, we must accept that there are no impersonal criteria to base our judgements on. That means value judgements have their basis in personal criteria, not grounded in goodness, truth, or rightness.

For Hume, where are we to derive these oughts? If not from a realm of facts -- things that are and have being -- from things that are not? from mere opinion?

Hume doesn't say this gap between _is_ and _ought_ can't be bridged. 
> _"For as this ought, or ought now, expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis necessar that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time that a reason should be given..._"

Only we can give this explanation between the _is_ and _ought_. I think this fair and right, intellectually speaking. But then I noticed a problem: Hume subtely contradicts himself by doing his is/ought fallacy right as he's arguing for giving an explaination for the gap. Yet he fails to notice he's making an is/ought jump: if there _is_ a gap, one _ought_ to provide the explanation for the relation. He goes from an observation to a value judgement while arguing that such should be backed up and while failing to provide a reason.

Hume builds a case for intellectual consistency while being metaphysically inconsistent.

I wonder why. Why _ought_ someone to provide an explanation for the unseen relation between an _is_ and an _ought_? I'm being a little metaphysical here on purpose, because I want to highlight the why.
 Hume is saying we should, but if I could go back to 1739 and ask him why we should, I honestly don't know what he would say. I don't know Hume's works that well yet honestly. I could imagine an appeal to intellectual honesty, which I respect, but there's no way to really know. But if he argues for bridging the gap because it keeps us honest, that means he's chest-deep in what C.S. Lewis calls "The Tao" -- that impersonal criteria of objective truth. 

No one can say we ought not to draw a value from a state of being, or that we ought to provide explanation for such a gap without himself having a presupposed reason. 

I am not anti-Hume. I do agree with him but to a point. He opens the door to let the flys out of 18th century rational thinking and leaves it open for dogs of subjectivism. Grounding the Is/Ought in why, whether it be honesty, consistency, or some such, might have been unfashionable to his way of thinking, bu

I think that the Tao makes Hume's point stronger, for it lurks in the background. Why provide explanation? Because honesty is good and it could keep us from making logical errors. Preventing logical errors can lead to better choices, less suffering, and a better understanding of why we have all this reason in the first place.
