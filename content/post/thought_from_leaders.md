In the Greek tradegy _Oedipus the King_ by Sophocles is a play about being caught up in strange fates, impasses and doom. It's a great read.
 What happens when one hurls themselves headlong into the pursuit of truth

It also has some nuggets about what it means to be a wise and good leader.

Initially sincere and rigorous, he'll stop at nothing to pursue the truth to find the pollution in the land. 
In his resolve he soon turns petulant and then hostile to the blind prophet Tieresius.
After Teiresias reluctantly tells Oedipus that he is the source of suffering in the land, Oedipus angrily accuses him of consipracy to overtake his throne
with his uncle. After a verbal brawl, the leader of the chorus implores:

> "We look at this man's words and yours, my king, and we find both have spoken them in anger. We need no angry words but only thought how we may best hit the god's meaning for us."

Anger and blame won't solve the problem. The people want _thought_ and leadership to get at the meaning of what is to be done. The people want judgement not insults.
At least they did over two-thousand years ago in Greece. We would be wise to ask the same from our leaders.

Perhaps the pursuit of truth alone
