Reading the classics of the western world might make you healthier, live longer, and happier. 
The great books are an equal opportunity boon. You can get them over-the-counter at any bookstore, and take at least once daily until you die.

How? This came to me while I was reading some of Plato's dialogues, the _Protagoras_ and the _Gorgias_. I don't have a randomized trial with a p-value less than five percent showing me this, but there are other strong reasons to believe in the prescription of good reading.

Here are three ways reading the classics can improve your health. Bear in mind, that by health we don't mean give you six-pack abs.

## You'll gain Clarity
When you read Plato's _Gorgias_ you'll meet quite the character, Callicles. Rough, dangerously stupid, he finally throws his hands up and says "whatever" to Socrates, and refuses to continue in the dialectic. But several important issues had yet to be decided in the discussion. They were talking about justice, natural law, and which is better: to _do_ or to _suffer_ injustice? Is good pleasure or something else? Stopping the discussion would be to leave the issues, and the earnestly listening attendants, in confusion.

Socrates entreats him to stay so they can 'put a head on it':
> "I suppose that all of us ought to be contentiously eager to know what's true and what's false...that it should become **clear** is a good common to all"

plato is dead on: clarity, just like organization, is a good.
 If keeping track of our keys and wallet is how much more of a good is it to have clarity on the 'big' questions of life?
Aristotle points out that, even back 2300 years ago, everyone wants happiness, yet so few people know what it is. how hard is it to hit a target when you don't know where it is?

The opposite of clarity is confusion. Confusion is a pollution. There's too much of it and it is not benign.
 Even confusion at a stoplight can be lethal. Confusion is a forerunner to disaster, chaos, and meaninglessnes. It manifests individually in the "quiet desperation" of one who is materially satisfied, yet confused about life, their purpose, if there's meaning in the world, has effects. our minds hate unintelligibility tied to important issues, and the confusion grinds us down with stress. stress sapps our physical, emotional, and social health. It might even prevent further learning by sapping our courage to try.

Plato was right. Pursuing clarity on the important questions is "a good common to all".

unfortunately, I'm not smart enough, nor will I live long enough to figure out the answers. But there have been some smart cookies across time, and they spent their lives trying to bridge the gap between their genius and me.
 Doublely fortunate that thousands of dedicated yet unknown actors spent their genius translating the original work into compelling and pungent english.

Reading is the exhilarating hike to ever higher peaks. You can see what Plato, or Dante saw. What a view.

---> So how do we gain clarity?
Telling what you see in a plain way can cheer people's souls. move them from a limited view of the world and themselves to a higher plane. it's participating in a rigorous but delightful intellectual journey.

## You'll be cheered
When i think of 'seers' one person who comes to mind is Socrates. Socrates was questioning the most famous thinker and sophist in greece, and the first to charge for his services, Protagoras.
Socrates' questions are lethal to bias and flat opinion. And as Socrates began to confound Protagoras, Protagoras resorts to lengthening his speeches and trying to win applause.

Prodicus, himself a sophist and an onlooker, pipes up as it looks like the discussion is going to fall apart.
He advises Socrates and Protagoras to continue the debate, but to "dispense with the eristics".

Eristics means a disputatious or contentious bearing in debate. the tools of this trade are scorn, accusations, fast talk, appeals to vanity and even unsupported opinion. 
Winning points to gain praise is great for the ego, but prodicus pleas with them to aim for a higher goal.

Prodicus himself gives a short speech contrasting such praise with good opinion. 
praise can often be a 'deceitful verbal expression', a chest-thumping and thoughtless thing, which appeals to ego.
good opinion is intrinsically felt "in the souls of the listeners".
 you may not know to clap because what you heard is working inside you still.

Such plain telling produces an effect prodicus calls 'cheering'.
 cheering is to participate in an intellectual exercise and thus be raised to a higher mental state.
 when one is cheered, they're educated, edified, and settling into a new viewpoint.

This made me think of how jesus in the new testament at times urged his disciples to "be of good cheer", almost as an invitation to come along with him and overcome fear.

William Faulkner spoke of great writings ability to bolster our hope in humanity, to encourage and uplift the spirit of man.

## You'll be cleansed
You're probably familiar with the juices, detoxes and cleanses as a way to detoxify your gut. But how does one detox their soul?

Harkeninig back to our friend Callicles. At one point Socrates finishes his argument that just people don't need oratory but oratory is useful for obstructing justice, Callicles cannot believe Socrates is serious.
> "...tell me, Socrates, are we to take you as being in earnest now or joking? for if you are in earnest, and these things you're saying are really true, won't this human life of ours be turned upside down, and won't everything we do eveidently be the oppposite of what we should do? (826/481c)

Philosophy isn't boring. It's dynamite. Don't believe me? Go read some Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, or Plato [links to individual pieces]. They'll blow you away. Then, like how once you think about white cars, you start seeing them everywhere, you'll start seeing your thoughts, people's passive comments, the news, your world-views all in a new light. Hopefully you'll have more clarity and be cheered and not go crazy. 

## A final word of caution
Not all who study philosophy turned out well. Seneca, a Stoic philosopher, tutored Nero. Reading widely is not the same as reading well [Adler link], and you should use common sense when reading these books. 

One of my all time favorite quotes is by John Ruskin, who said, 
> "The greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to see something and tell what it saw in a plain way. Hundreds of people can talk for one who can think, but thousands can think for one who can see." 

Seers are few then, but when they tell what they see in a plain way, their talk is profoundly edifying.
They say you're the average of the five people you spend the most time with. so invite plato, aristotle, homer, aquinas, and shakespeare into your mind. it won't be a waste of time. they won't try to get you to click and subscribe, upsell you or distract you with popups. they saw what they saw, and said what they said in a plain way. they're tellers not sellers. and if we listen to what they have to say, perhaps we'll start to see things a little more clearly than before.
