A year ago, free will was freedom to do what I wish.
 To eat a bowl of delicious honey nut cherrios now or later.
 To wear the button down shirt I wore yesterday that doesn't smell bad, or a fresh one.
 Also, to decide who I will be, my attitudes, my priorities.
 To be the captain of my soul.
 That fullness of ability I often neglect yet can still be inspired by.
 That was free will.

Then all of a sudden I was thrown into confusion.
 Hanging out with friends one night, one was talking about how hard it was to remember to buy gifts for his wife.
 Then he said, "but of course, there is no free will, so...". 
Immediately I was curious. How could such a common experience such as free will be thought not to exist? What does that mean for me?

For the following hour, we fleshed it out.
 He spoke about genetic and cultural determination guiding our emotions, desires, habits -- all actually beyond our control.
 He talked about how everything is just cause and effect.
 We only think free will exists.

I brought up moral ramifications of behaving like there was no free will. I talked about the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and randomness in quantum mechanics, yet I still felt I didn't, no, couldn't refute his points from a scientific perspective. My moral arguments were taken as "yeah, that's nice, but still that's just how it is."

I doubt my friend realized what he had unleashed (there's cause and effect for you!). I started learning about the raging debate over our free will that I never knew existed. 

## What is free will?
But before we go on, we ought to define our terms. What do we mean by free? What do we mean by will?

There are various definitions, but I like the [Oxford English Language dictionary's take](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+free+will):
> "The power of acting without the constraint of necessity or fate; the ability to act at one's own discretion"

## What debate?
Do we have any control of our lives? And what are the ramifications of the answer? These two questions are at the eye of the storm in the free will debate for centuries. 
~~The question centers around whether we possess any ability to choose or are fooling ourselves, being numb to the millions of tiny inert particles orchestrating a grand illusion of choice.~~
Naturally there are myriad opinions, but three main positions have formed around the debate.

### Free will libertarians
Some of free will's toughest defenders were early Catholic church fathers and scholastics. One example is [John Dun Scotus](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/#AnciMediPeri) saying:
> “Nothing other than the will is the total cause”

Other, more modern voices, such as [John Horgan](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/my-go-to-arguments-for-free-will/) say
> "Free will must exist if some of us have more of it than others."

We can choose for ourselves despite external forces and internal impulses.
 Yes I had cravings and impulses to eat that burrito, but I still made a conscious choice to get it.
 The fate of the burrito rests in my hands, so to speak.

This is the side of free will libertarianism, where we have complete free will over all our thoughts, feelings and actions. 


### Determinists 
Free will's opponents are no less resolute or convincing.

There are many in the modern variety, like Sam Harris, proclaiming:
> “Free will is an illusion” 

or Baron D’Holbach a French intellectual and atheist:
> “We’re all just cogs in a machine doing what we were meant to do with no actual volition”

They believe (though I don't know if they would say 'believe') that everything, including us - our thoughts, feelings, actions etc - is determined according to the laws of Nature.
 You’re spontaneous action or thought didn’t originate from ‘you’ but was predictable and even unavoidable given the laws of cause and effect.
 They claim that if they had all the variables they could show that we have no free will because everything is just cause and effect.
 
From a determinist perspective, I was destined to indigestion after that burrito since time immemorial.
 Randomness is impossible.
 And while it might not make us feel warm and fuzzy, hey, it's science. 

This is the side of hard determinism, where Newton's laws forbid anything in the physical world that doesn't follow cause and effect.


### Compatibilists
Unshockingly, there is a view that seeks to unite our experience of free will with the sternness of science.

It says we can call an action free if it comes from within ourselves.
Yes, our situation is the result of past actions but if I chose otherwise I could have done otherwise.
 Determinism cannot force me against choosing otherwise.
 Classical thinkers of this ilk were Hobbes, Locke, and Hume.

Each of these views takes a position on what things influence us.
 It is hard to know how much of external or internal factors influence our choices and actions.
 Free will libertarianism, determinism, and compatiblism shift the weight around.

## Commencement 
Surprisingly, after milennia of philosophical debate, people still find it difficult to come to terms with the basis of the debate.
 It's a tough problem indeed.
 Yet, with the advances in our understanding of the brain, some in the scientific community are pointing to the end of free will.
 Physics has free will in a headlock.
 A checkmate.
Some acquiese that free will is dead, but for the sake of society, think we ought to pretend it's real.
There are a few who go even further, saying let's throw off the illusion and awake to the reality that we're "being played by the universe". 

This is not a matter for scientists, philosophers, or public policy figures only.
This is a human matter, and one we would do well to think deeply and often about. It's challenging but rewarding.

Spending the last several months thinking and [notetaking]() on free will has lead me to deeper areas to explore, has taught me things I didn't know about myself, and helped restore my faith in the transcendent. 

If anything, at least I won't be unprepared for the next dinner party.

Consider this the beginning of an intermittent series exploring free will, and questions such as:

 - Does not believing in free will make one more or less jugdemental?
 - What are the implications if free will does/doesn't exist?
 - If free will exists, what else exists?
 - Does physics hold the key?

Join me, won't you!?
