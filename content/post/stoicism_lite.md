Much is said and written of Stoicism these days. If you haven't heard of it yet, I'd be very surprised. Yet, I'd be even more surprised if, already familiar with stoicism, you learned about it in school. 
I sure didn't. "Stoic" was the name of the dad in _How to Train your Dragon_, and that didn't give the best impression. 

So why is it so popular today, especially if most of us didn't major in philosophy?

My bet is YouTube and podcasts. At least, that's where I hear the most about it. A few writers like Tim Ferriss, Ryan Holiday, and Massimo Pigliucci have written and spoken about Stoicism, and by doing so, introduced into the mainstream a millenia old philosophy with a growing following.

Why the growing following? I wonder if selling Stoicism in prosperous times would be a tougher sell, but (in case you haven't noticed) things have been pretty rough for a while. Now our bad news is as global as our economy. Inundated with choices, pressures, and uncertainties, to me it's no surprise a philosophy that trains people to focus on what they can control and let go of what they can't resonates.

Stoicism finds a ready buyer[1] in today's intellectual market for at least a few reasons:

1. It sounds cool. Perhaps that's not how you'll introduce yourself on a date, but saying "I'm a Stoic" means something kinda badass.
2. Stoicism simplifies life. Training your mind to "focus on what you can control and leave what you can't" might sound like a withdrawl from life, and this is a criticism[2] that some still levy against Stocism. Yet this is not the end of the philosophy, but merely a way to begin; to calm down, focus your energies and emotions in amenable ways.
3. It doesn't come with heavy religious baggage. You don't have to pay to join an organization, undergo any ritual of joining a church or anything that might upset modern secular sensibilities. So much of what's ancient, like an old house, smells funny. And we'd like to admire the works of our ancestors from a mural or a musuem rather than a repetition. Stocism has a low barrier to entry and doesn't ask you to believe anything in the religious realm. A christian Stoic and an atheist Stoic would get along just fine.
4. Stocism doesn't have to get too woo-woo mystical. 
5. It presents an end, a goal: to become a virtuous person through virtuous living. The Stoic strives, focusing on what they can control, on being wise, temperate, courageous, and just.

I discovered Stoicism at a great time for me.
I had left my religion and was searching in philosophies at the time, and frankly had no idea what I was doing.
 One day I stumbled upon a lecture by Michael Sugrue on Marcus Aurelius and the Stoic ideal. Perhaps it was Sugrue's teaching style which was spellbinding for me and drew me in, like a moth to the flame, that made Stoicism seem plausible. When I learned that it was about how to live well, I started reading and digging in more. This was late 2020.
 I didn't know a world-wide life-threatening pandemic was a few months away, and that I would get it before vaccines were available.
 The same week the pandemic started shutting everything down, an earthquake hit the area I lived in.
 We were shaken inside and out.

I can honestly say that the more I applied the practices of Stoicism, the calmer I felt. I felt more centered and less worried, and that couldn't have come at a better time. 
Yet, I also felt something lacking.
 I knew Stoicism was good but I hoped there was more.
 It wasn't until later in 2020 when I began reading Plato that my itch was scratched. 

### Stoicism lite
After reading Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Seneca and books about Stoicism and many other philosophers, only now do I think I understand the heart of Stoicism and it's weakness.

Here are some of my critiques:
0. Stoicism-lite says take the means but dispense with the ends. Use mental exercises and mantras to calm you down, help you focus, manage your [emotions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kwamechristian/2022/06/20/stoicism-the-secret-to-managing-emotional-triggers/?sh=64dcb79f17bf) and leave it at that. Of course, this is no sin. Stoicism doesn't really have a god you're pissing off. However the crutches without the end isn't really Stoicism in my view. Just like focusing on doing good to one's neighbor and practicing forgiveness while being an Atheist isn't exactly Christian. Perhaps that's not the best example, but I hope you see my point. 
It's not Stoicism's fault that it's being applied shallowly. But though sold as a "no metaphysical strings attached" philosophy, I don't think that's quite true if we're dealing with the Stoicism of Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus. 
1. "Oh, so you say you're a Stoic eh? Cool, so what is justice?" Just like that Socrates is on to you. When all you've been brainwashed into by Ryan Holiday is some Roman history of Cato and Marcus Aurelius is "focus on what you can control", "Momento Mori", "Amor Fati" and the Stoic Pillars "Wisdom, Temperance, Courage, and Justice" you're probably unable to do the basics. 
I'm not saying these aren't great things to aim for. They are excellent. But I've wrestled with a wrestler, Plato, in struggling to know _why_ justice rather than injustice is worth striving for.
