### Dilemmas
_ years ago, Schopenhauer threw out the Hedgehog dilemma:

If two hedgehogs get too close, they will poke each other with their spikes and be hurt.
If they move too far apart, they will be lonely.

And so it is with us at times. Get too close, we invade boundaries, irritate, provoke and hurt each other. But separated, we suffer in loneliness.

Which would you take?

### Pain
There's the pain of working towards a fitness goal.
 Getting up and running 5 miles when it's below freezing, saying no to chocolate shakes and pizza, feeling awkward doing jumping jacks in your living room hoping your neighbors can't see. 
What if it doesn't work? What if I look like a fool?
This is the pain of trying. Of working. Of discipline.

Then there's the pain of staying stuck, wondering, worrying about what ifs. This is the malaise of inaction and hopelessness.

Which would you take?

### Suffering
When we strive to overcome our impulses, weaknesses, or strive in the search of meaning, it involves a level of suffering. The uncertainty threatens to rob all our effort of meaning.

Dwelling in confusion about what our purpose is, disolving our resolve and belief in truth, in meaning in this world, there is a great deal of suffering.

Which would you take?

### Might as well
If you're going to have pain, if you're going to suffer might as well suffer for something
