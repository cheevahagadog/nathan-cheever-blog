While awaiting his execution in prison in 524 AD, Boethius wrote a short work that would become a best-seller for a thousand years: "The Consolation of Philosophy". In it, he concludes that bad luck is more favorable to humans than good fortune.

Why? Fortune (personified as a fickle goddess) is more honest in revealing her ways than good luck, which can easily deceive us into false security. We are more free through realizing our fragility than with the cloying pampering of good luck. It helps us know ourselves better, and that is pretty important.

Still, adversity stinks, but it doesn't have to control our inner state if we choose. There is something better than good luck.
