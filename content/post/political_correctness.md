## Just Respect Mobilized?
I'm not sure I know exactly what political correctness (to be referred to by 'PC' from here on out) is. Is it speaking up for the historically marginalized, dispossessed of power? No, I don't think so. That is activism, likely for political rights and status. 
And activism means expressing point publicly to cause a political or societal change. So I can see how the 'political' aspect of PC can be associated with political activism, standing up for causes and such. 

To my way of thinking, one may express a political opinion, demonstrate, be active, etc. on a number of issues, whether being on the side of formally unquestionably held power (like the far right) or on the side

So political correctness, at least to me, is a manner for speaking and acting that continues the rally, the demonstration but in everyday life. Everywhere where PC is, is a march for something.

But do we really think about what we're marching for? And where it might lead?

I imagine a defender of PC might say, "PC is all about treating people with respect they deserve (and have been denied for too long)." No doubt, this is sadly true that people have been disrespected, often on categorical basis of color of skin, gender, race, and all the rest.

Saying PC is about respect is a respectable thing to say. But is PC just respect mobilized?

### Differences between PC and respect
PC says you _ought_ to speak and behave a certain way _because_ of events, biases, and setbacks that need to be overcome in regards to categories of people.
Respect beckons you to value a _person_ as special. Not because of a category, not because of setbacks, events, or historical event. The _why_ might be less gripping, but respect asks you to see others as an end in-and-of themselves. That they and we are all dear and special, not for what we represent, but rather for what we are -- human beings. 

PC is more reactive as it needs justification from the past, at least on a superficial level. Respect, though our conceptions of human value, purpose, etc. have evolved over the millenia) on the other hand is a-historical, especially in the Judaeo-christian West.

### Why be politically correct? 
Did you receive an invitation in the mail to join in the march of PC? I think not. Yet PC's influence is ubiquitous. So why conform? Fear of sticking out, social pressure, having your character demeaned if you say 'Native American' instead of the latest 'First nation peoples', or even worse 'Indian'.

Or maybe you immediately resonated with the message and saw this as a way to advance towards great social justice and fairness.

### Why treat others with respect?
This, taken seriously, is a more challenging question metaphysically. 
Why? Because it depends on how you see humanity or a portion of humanity.

If you're thinking that 'respect isn't enough', then it sure isn't respect your in the game for. It's something else.
