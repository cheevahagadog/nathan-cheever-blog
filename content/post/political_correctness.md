Have you ever 

Political correctness (PC) is sometimes seen as progress towards justice for groups of people not treated fairly. For others, a nuisance that inhibits free thought and speech and, taken too far, leads to a loss of personal liberty.

Struggles between equality and liberty are not new. Yet the place of PC and its worthiness as a morality have increasingly been in question.

So it's worth a look at just what PC is: progress or decline?

### Just what is it?
The definition of PC reads:
> "the avoidance, often considered as taken to extremes, of forms of expression or action that are perceived to exclude, marginalize, or insult groups of people who are socially disadvantaged or discriminated against."[^1]

I asked a friend who himself is diligent in his PC. He told me that PC is all about being sensitive to others' experience and the negative associations of words or phrases that cause them harm.

I then asked him how PC is manifest or practiced in his life. He told me, by abstaining from speech, shopping at places that are incorrect, etc.

### An obvious but necessary question: _Why care?_
The question for me is, _why_ should I care? I ask this sincerely, not in a flippant manner, because I want to know _why_. I want to know the grounds PC invokes for calling on everyone to care about the mistreatment of groups of people. It's a good question, and if PC has good grounds, then I'll sign up.

I can imagine a few reasons offered as to why I should be politically correct. One is "PC is basically a way of treating ". Perhaps we were raised to respect others, but that principle was too provincial in its teaching, and we didn't learn that that rule extended to minorities. PC is the needed upgrade of general respect, patching over missed categories. It is respect at scale.

**However PC is not equal to respect. Here's why.**

The word "correctness" means conformity to a standard, truth, or fact. Therefore, to be politically correct, you must conform to negative action in the name of justice, fairness, and/or equality as a reaction to recent historical events of mistreatment.

Respect beckons you to value a _person_ as special. They are an end in-and-of themselves. Respect is unaware of categories. It is also less reactive to historical events. 

Why one would treat another with respect comes down to one's view of humanity. 
Respect comes from how you view a person. PC comes from how you view

Respect comes out of a person for another person. You value their quality, their potential, their divine specialness, and you treat them accordingly. Respect for humanity focuses on our shared humanity.

**PC is a degraded form of respect, in that it wields its power with social pressure rather than moral persuasion.**

This is not to say that a person who respects another is "politically incorrect". They will not do or say harm, but they'll have a reason why they don't, whereas the PC adherent only knows because he's been told.

But trying to convince someone to respect another person as a human can be hard. PC is a lot easier. No moral persuasion is involved, only outward compliance. The tongue may be correct to the latest terms but the mind and the heart may remain resentful. It is that level, the moral persuasion level where PC fails the most because it cannot supply reasons outside of itself to justify its moral claims. Respect takes moral persuasion to win over the bad ideas. PC just covers over them. But demanding conformity to a hollow principle does as much good as a bad principle in persuading someone to change their mind.

PC has effective means of informing the public of its rules via writers and broadcasters. In a way, this might be a way of evangelizing the sensitivity towards overlooked and oppressed people. Such might genuinely inform someone who already respects others and now their sympathy and care will go out to them. In this way, PC has notched a victory by informing with information a soul already informed with respect and morality. Yet PC's effectiveness _ presupposes this respect without having a way to teach or explain it.
Yet PC evangelists are presumptuous in presupposing such respect in their audience to make effective use of the information and at worst,  

Just as respect is not the same as PC, neither is its opposite. Rude and disrespectful speech is common, even in our music. Yet every time we hear the "F" word we don't find it politically incorrect? Why? Because it is a-categorical, not sensitive to recent events. So while profanity itself can be disrespectful to a person, it doesn't partake in PC unless attached to a category of people.

Taking it a step further, what is PC's approach to society at large? Can one be polititcally correct towards society? It seems a conflict in terms. As far as one's morality is informed by PC, they remain illiterate for _why_ sensitivity ought to be shown to the individual (and hence the lack of care for individual rights) and unable to understand how deference _can_ be shown to society or even humanity at large. Once they step off the edge of a category of people and recent offenses, they are without reason and tools for arguing for a concept of morality. PC only has cogency around categories but is mute for the most basic category: human society. Therefore, as is common, one may easily blame the problems of today on "society" and not incur a PC backlash.

The core of PC's morality is sensitivity. PC is therefore essentially consequentialist or utilitarian morality. Actions are wrong because of the pain alledgedly caused. To the extent that PC maintains speech and action as incorrect because of insensitivity to pain, it remains utilitarian. The Utilitarian calculus fixes the rightness or wrongness of actions according to the pain or pleasure caused. Utilitarianism as a moral system is rife with problems. If a majority of white people have "pleasure" in making jokes at a minority's expense, isn't that the most _good_ for the most people? According to Utilitarian logic, yes. 

**This is the great irony of PC: it makes moral judgments without a categorically right or wrong foundation but _applies_ them on a categorical way.** 

I can only say that in good intentions, PC is a specious and dangerous morality. We've discussed reasons for its speciousness. But it's danger can be seen in the recent years of militantcy. The Cancel culture movement is one main example.

And yet, such a popular morality with these features should be no surprise in our time. It was predicted by Nietzsche, C.S. Lewis, and Alasdair McIntyre, who clearly saw and wrote about what happens when theere is no ipoersonal objective criteria or yardsick that people can use to decide moral questsions. Like traffic moving pass/thru an intersection, without an impartial arbitrator, a stop light system or police man to direct traffic, all of which manifest an agreed upon set of rules, getting through becomes a question of aggression, of power and push.





## Just Respect Mobilized?
I'm not sure I know exactly what political correctness (to be referred to by 'PC' from here on out) is. Is it speaking up for the historically marginalized, dispossessed of power? No, I don't think so. That is activism, likely for political rights and status. 
And activism means expressing point publicly to cause a political or societal change. So I can see how the 'political' aspect of PC can be associated with political activism, standing up for causes and such. 

To my way of thinking, one may express a political opinion, demonstrate, be active, etc. on a number of issues, whether being on the side of formally unquestionably held power (like the far right) or on the side

So political correctness, at least to me, is a manner for speaking and acting that continues the rally, the demonstration but in everyday life. Everywhere where PC is, is a march for something.

But do we really think about what we're marching for? And where it might lead?

I imagine a defender of PC might say, "PC is all about treating people with respect they deserve (and have been denied for too long)." No doubt, this is sadly true that people have been disrespected, often on categorical basis of color of skin, gender, race, and all the rest.

Saying PC is about respect is a respectable thing to say. But is PC just respect mobilized?

### Differences between PC and respect
PC says you _ought_ to speak and behave a certain way _because_ of events, biases, and setbacks that need to be overcome in regards to categories of people.
Respect beckons you to value a _person_ as special. Not because of a category, not because of setbacks, events, or historical event. The _why_ might be less gripping, but respect asks you to see others as an end in-and-of themselves. That they and we are all dear and special, not for what we represent, but rather for what we are -- human beings. 

PC is more reactive as it needs justification from the past, at least on a superficial level. Respect, though our conceptions of human value, purpose, etc. have evolved over the millenia) on the other hand is a-historical, especially in the Judaeo-christian West.

### Why be politically correct? 
Did you receive an invitation in the mail to join in the march of PC? I think not. Yet PC's influence is ubiquitous. So why conform? Fear of sticking out, social pressure, having your character demeaned if you say 'Native American' instead of the latest 'First nation peoples', or even worse 'Indian'.

Or maybe you immediately resonated with the message and saw this as a way to advance towards great social justice and fairness.

### Why treat others with respect?
This, taken seriously, is a more challenging question metaphysically. 
Why? Because it depends on how you see humanity or a portion of humanity.

If you're thinking that 'respect isn't enough', then it sure isn't respect your in the game for. It's something else.
