> "We can be knowledgeable with other men's knowledge but not wise with other men's wisdom"

What kind of thing is wisdom? Some have it. I don't. But I cannot take it from them like I could a plant or a chair. It's a very possessed possession. To successfully take it would be to take the person.

These are my thoughts on wisdom.

### A character capacity
Wisdom is not information. Information can be picked up and transferred. It possesses itself. 

Wisdom is conceived in wonder and observation. The boundaries are noted. Limitations, extents and capacities manifest themselves. The turn to see these capacities and limitations within oneself is a step towards wisdom. The observation must transfer contexts and find an application within.

Turning to observe the finitude and capacities of ourselves manifests a truth. We are mortal. We are limited, but not impotent. The carving out of capacity through reflection and experimentation, creates a motivation and guidance on how to grow these capacities.

A fool, either by lack of care or ability to look and see the way nature has bounded man and itself, is unaware of limitations. He lacks good approximation for capacities of himself and things. And he likely thinks he has more ability or knowledge than he does and is therefore less motivated to seek to improve it. He has enough when he really has hardly anything at all.

As a rule, to be truly wise is to possess humility. Sensing in humility his place on the mountain of challenges, he knows where to climb. What information to understand. Each climb reveals more and more of the shape of the world and himself.

He only saw what he saw because of the heights he scaled. He ascended to it.

The fool sees nothing but flatness and yet complains it's too difficult.
