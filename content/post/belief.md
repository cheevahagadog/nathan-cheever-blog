We are primarily believing creatures. Based on our beliefs, our presuppositions and values, we act. Action is no guarrantee for sensible action just as belief is no guarrantee for rational belief, but our beliefs always come first.

## The wager
People can be rational and arrive at different conclusions. 

Take the question "Is there a God?" [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_wager) saw our lives as a bet on this question. He arrived at the conclusion that we ought to live as though God did exist based on a microeconomic risk and reward decision theory. Belief in God and good deeds were rational.

Let's compare him to Marcus Aurelius, the Emperor of Rome and Stoic philosopher. Aurelius wasn't sure if the Gods existed, but he believed that living a just life would make him a fiend of the gods, if they exist. If not, no big deal. Either way, being just is living according to nature of universal law. Living according to nature, for Aurelius, was the only proper and rational way to live.

For Pascal, the logic of risk minimalization. For Aurelius, the logic of proper action.
Both concluded that living a good life was one's best bet, though from different rational trains. One based on risk minimalization, the other based on a belief in the universal order and man's place in it.

I know I'm not doing justice to either of their philosophies. Suffice it to say both Pascal and Aurelius proceeded rationally from their different belief points and arrived at a similar conclusion.  

Let's compare Pascal's conclusion with a new Athiest's conclusion about God. 

A belief system is a foundation, a launch pad for human rationality.
